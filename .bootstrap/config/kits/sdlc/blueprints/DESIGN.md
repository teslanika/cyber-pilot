# DESIGN Blueprint
Blueprint for Technical Design Documents.

This file is the single source of truth for:
- template.md generation (from @cpt:heading + @cpt:prompt markers)
- example.md generation (from @cpt:heading examples + @cpt:example markers)
- rules.md generation (from @cpt:rules + @cpt:rule markers)
- checklist.md generation (from @cpt:checklist + @cpt:check markers)
- constraints.toml contributions (from @cpt:heading + @cpt:id markers)

All text between markers is ignored by the generator.

DESIGN is the system blueprint: architecture, components, boundaries,
interfaces, drivers, principles, and constraints.
Based on: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022, IEEE 1016-2009

### DESIGN Commands
- `cypilot validate --artifact <DESIGN.md>` — validate DESIGN structure and IDs
- `cypilot list-ids --kind component` — list all components
- `cypilot list-ids --kind principle` — list all design principles
- `cypilot where-defined --id <id>` — find where a DESIGN ID is defined
- `cypilot where-used --id <id>` — find where a DESIGN ID is referenced downstream
### DESIGN Workflows
- **Generate DESIGN**: create a new DESIGN from template with guided prompts per section
- **Analyze DESIGN**: validate structure (deterministic) then semantic quality (checklist-based)
```

- [ ] Format: `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-type-{slug}-v2`, `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-comp-{slug}-v3`, etc.
- [ ] Keep changelog of significant changes
```

#### Semantic

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-semantic`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "semantic"
```
```markdown
**Reference**: `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/checklist.md` for detailed semantic criteria

- [ ] Architecture overview is complete and clear
- [ ] Domain model defines all core types
- [ ] Components have clear responsibilities and boundaries
- [ ] Integration points documented
- [ ] ADR references provided for key decisions
- [ ] PRD capabilities traced to components
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-semantic`

#### Scope

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-scope`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "scope"
```
```markdown
**One DESIGN per system/subsystem**. Match scope to architectural boundaries.

| Scope | Examples | Guideline |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Too broad** | "Entire platform design" for 50+ components | Split into subsystem DESIGNs |
| **Right size** | "Auth subsystem design" covering auth components | Clear boundary, manageable size |
| **Too narrow** | "Login button component design" | Implementation detail, use SPEC |

**DESIGN-worthy content**:
- System/subsystem architecture overview
- Domain model (core types, relationships)
- Component responsibilities and boundaries
- Integration points and contracts
- Key architectural decisions (reference ADRs)

**NOT DESIGN-worthy** (use SPEC instead):
- Individual spec implementation details
- UI flows and interactions
- Algorithm pseudo-code
- Test scenarios

**Relationship to other artifacts**:
- **PRD** → DESIGN: PRD defines WHAT, DESIGN defines HOW (high-level)
- **DESIGN** → DECOMPOSITION: DESIGN defines architecture, DECOMPOSITION lists implementations
- **DESIGN** → SPEC: DESIGN provides context, SPEC details implementation
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-scope`

#### Traceability

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/rules.md`.

```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "traceability"
```
```markdown
- [ ] When component fully implemented → mark component `[x]` in DESIGN
- [ ] When all components for ADR implemented → update ADR status (PROPOSED → ACCEPTED)
- [ ] When all design elements for PRD capability implemented → mark capability `[x]` in PRD
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-traceability`

#### Constraints

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/rules.md`.

```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "constraints"
```
```markdown
- [ ] ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/constraints.toml` (kit root)
- [ ] Treat `constraints.toml` as primary validator for:
  - where IDs are defined
  - where IDs are referenced
  - which cross-artifact references are required / optional / prohibited

**References**:
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/requirements/kit-constraints.md`
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/schemas/kit-constraints.schema.json`

**Validation Checks**:
- `cypilot validate` enforces `identifiers[<kind>].references` rules (required / optional / prohibited)
- `cypilot validate` enforces headings scoping for ID definitions and references
- `cypilot validate` enforces "checked ref implies checked def" consistency

section = "deliberate_omissions"
```
```markdown
DESIGN documents must NOT contain the following — report as violation if found:

- **ARCH-DESIGN-NO-001**: No Spec-Level Details (CRITICAL) — DESIGN captures architecture, not feature specs
- **ARCH-DESIGN-NO-002**: No Decision Debates (HIGH) — debates belong in ADR
- **BIZ-DESIGN-NO-003**: No Product Requirements (HIGH) — requirements belong in PRD
- **BIZ-DESIGN-NO-004**: No Implementation Tasks (HIGH) — tasks belong in DECOMPOSITION
- **DATA-DESIGN-NO-001**: No Code-Level Schema Definitions (MEDIUM) — code schemas belong in implementation
- **INT-DESIGN-NO-001**: No Complete API Specifications (MEDIUM) — full API specs belong in FEATURE
- **OPS-DESIGN-NO-001**: No Infrastructure Code (MEDIUM) — infra code belongs in implementation
- **TEST-DESIGN-NO-001**: No Test Code (MEDIUM) — test code belongs in implementation
- **MAINT-DESIGN-NO-001**: No Code Snippets (HIGH) — code belongs in implementation
- **SEC-DESIGN-NO-001**: No Security Secrets (CRITICAL) — secrets must never appear in documentation

````markdown
**Apply checklist.md semantics during creation:**

| Checklist Section | Generation Task |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| ARCH-DESIGN-001: Architecture Overview | Document system purpose, high-level architecture, context diagram |
| ARCH-DESIGN-002: Principles Coherence | Define actionable, non-contradictory principles |
| DOMAIN-DESIGN-001: Domain Model | Define types, relationships, boundaries |
| COMP-DESIGN-001: Component Design | Define responsibilities, interfaces, dependencies |

**Partial Completion Handling**:

If DESIGN cannot be completed in a single session:
1. **Checkpoint progress**:
   - Note completed sections (Architecture, Domain, Components, etc.)
   - Note current section being worked on
   - List remaining sections
2. **Ensure valid intermediate state**:
   - All completed sections must be internally consistent
   - Add `status: DRAFT` to frontmatter
   - Mark incomplete sections with `INCOMPLETE: {reason}`
3. **Document resumption point**:
   ```
   DESIGN checkpoint:
   - Completed: Architecture Overview, Domain Model
   - In progress: Component Design (3/7 components)
   - Remaining: Sequences, Data Model
   - Resume: Continue with component cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-comp-{slug}
   ```
4. **On resume**:
   - Verify PRD unchanged since last session
   - Continue from documented checkpoint
   - Remove incomplete markers as sections are finished

#### Applicability Context

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:validation-applicability`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "validation"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "applicability"
```
```markdown
Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the artifact's domain** — What kind of system/project is this DESIGN for? (e.g., web service, CLI tool, data pipeline, methodology framework)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all designs:
   - A CLI tool design may not need Security Architecture analysis
   - A methodology framework design may not need Performance Architecture analysis
   - A local development tool design may not need Operations Architecture analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"
```
`@/cpt:rule:validation-applicability`

#### Report Format

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/rules.md`.

# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "validation"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "report_format"
```
````markdown
Report **only** problems (do not list what is OK).

For each issue include:

- **Why Applicable**: Explain why this requirement applies to this specific DESIGN's context
- **Checklist Item**: `{CHECKLIST-ID}` — {Checklist item title}
- **Severity**: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW
- **Issue**: What is wrong (requirement missing or incomplete)
- **Evidence**: Quote the exact text or "No mention found"
- **Why it matters**: Impact (risk, cost, user harm, compliance)
- **Proposal**: Concrete fix with clear acceptance criteria

### Compact Report Format (Quick Reviews)

For quick reviews, use this condensed table format:

```markdown
## DESIGN Review Summary

| ID | Severity | Issue | Proposal |
|----|----------|-------|----------|
| ARCH-DESIGN-001 | HIGH | Missing context diagram | Add system context diagram to Section A |
| ARCH-DESIGN-005 | MEDIUM | No schema location | Add path to domain types in Section C.1 |

**Applicability**: {System type} — checked {N} priority domains, {M} marked N/A

```
```markdown
When reviewing PRs that add or change design documents, additionally focus on:

- [ ] Alignment with existing architecture (see project DESIGN artifacts)
- [ ] Trade-off analysis — are alternatives considered and justified?
- [ ] API contract consistency with existing endpoints and conventions
- [ ] Security considerations — authentication, authorization, data protection
- [ ] Compliance with `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/template.md` structure (generated from blueprint)
- [ ] Identify antipatterns — god objects, leaky abstractions, tight coupling
- [ ] Compare proposed design with existing industry patterns in SaaS platforms
- [ ] Compare proposed design with IEEE, ISO, and other industry standards where applicable
- [ ] Critical assessment of design decisions — challenge assumptions and gaps
- [ ] Split findings by checklist category and rate each 1-10

# DESIGN (Overall Design) Expert Checklist

**Artifact**: Overall System Design (DESIGN)
**Version**: 2.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03
**Purpose**: Comprehensive quality checklist for Overall Design artifacts

---

## Referenced Standards

This checklist validates system design artifacts based on the following international standards:

| Standard | Domain | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [IEEE 1016-2009](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1016/4502/) | **Design Description** | Software Design Descriptions — context, composition, logical, dependency viewpoints |
| [ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html) | **Architecture Description** | Architecture viewpoints, stakeholders, concerns, model correspondences |
| [ISO/IEC 25010:2011](https://www.iso.org/standard/35733.html) | **Quality Model** | SQuaRE — 8 quality characteristics: performance, security, reliability, maintainability |
| [ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/72089.html) | **Requirements Traceability** | Bidirectional traceability, requirements-to-design mapping |
| [OWASP ASVS 5.0](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) | **Security Architecture** | Authentication, authorization, cryptography, data protection |
| [ISO/IEC 27001:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) | **Information Security** | ISMS controls, security management framework |
---

## Review Scope Selection

**Choose review mode based on DESIGN scope and change type**:

| Review Mode | When to Use | Domains to Check |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Quick** | Minor updates, <3 sections changed | ARCH (core only) + changed domains |
| **Standard** | New DESIGN, moderate changes | All applicable domains |
| **Full** | Major architectural changes, compliance-critical | All 12 domains with evidence |

### Quick Review (ARCH Core Only)

**MUST CHECK** (blocking):
- [ ] ARCH-DESIGN-001: Architecture Overview Completeness
- [ ] ARCH-DESIGN-004: Component Model Quality
- [ ] ARCH-DESIGN-005: Domain Model Authority
- [ ] DOC-DESIGN-001: Explicit Non-Applicability

**Changed sections** — also check relevant domain items for any sections modified.

### Domain Prioritization by System Type

| System Type | Priority Domains (check first) | Secondary Domains | Often N/A |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Web Service** | ARCH, SEC, REL, DATA, INT | PERF, OPS, TEST | UX, COMPL |
| **CLI Tool** | ARCH, MAINT, TEST | DATA, INT | SEC, PERF, OPS, COMPL, UX |
| **Data Pipeline** | ARCH, DATA, REL, PERF | INT, OPS | SEC, UX, COMPL |
| **Methodology/Framework** | ARCH, MAINT | TEST | SEC, PERF, REL, DATA, INT, OPS, COMPL, UX |
| **Mobile App** | ARCH, UX, SEC, PERF | DATA, TEST | OPS, INT, COMPL |

**Applicability Rule**: Domains in "Often N/A" column still require explicit "Not applicable because..." statement in document if skipped.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates DESIGN artifacts
- [ ] I will follow the Applicability Context rules below
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] I will complete the Final Checklist and provide a review report

---

## Evidence Requirements (STRICT mode)

**When Rules Mode = STRICT** (per `{cypilot_path}/.core/requirements/agent-compliance.md`):

### For Each Checklist Category

Agent MUST output evidence in this format:

| Category ID | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| ARCH-DESIGN-001 | PASS | Lines 45-67: "System purpose is to provide..." |
| ARCH-DESIGN-002 | PASS | Section B.1 contains 9 principles with unique IDs |
| PERF-DESIGN-001 | N/A | Line 698: "Performance architecture not applicable..." |

### Evidence Standards

**For PASS**:
- Quote 2-5 sentences from document proving requirement is met
- Include line numbers or section references
- Evidence must directly demonstrate compliance

**For N/A (Not Applicable)**:
- Quote the **explicit** "Not applicable because..." statement from document
- If no explicit statement exists → report as VIOLATION, not N/A
- Agent CANNOT decide N/A on author's behalf — document must state it

**For FAIL**:
- State what's missing or incorrect
- Provide location where it should be
- Quote surrounding context

### Why Evidence Matters

Without evidence requirements, agents exhibit anti-pattern AP-004 (BULK_PASS):
- Report "all checks pass" without actually verifying each item
- Skip tedious checklist review
- Produce invalid validation that misses real issues

**Real example of this failure**:
> Agent reported "DESIGN validation PASS" without reading the file, because deterministic gate passed and agent assumed semantic review was optional.

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the artifact's domain** — What kind of system/project is this DESIGN for? (e.g., web service, CLI tool, data pipeline, methodology framework)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all designs:
   - A CLI tool design may not need Security Architecture analysis
   - A methodology framework design may not need Performance Architecture analysis
   - A local development tool design may not need Operations Architecture analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it's not mentioned. Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Unsafe/misleading/unverifiable; blocks downstream work.
- **HIGH**: Major ambiguity/risk; should be fixed before approval.
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

## Template Structure

Headings, prompts, IDs, and examples that define the generated `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/template.md`
and `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/examples/example.md` files. The DESIGN template covers: architecture overview,
domain model, components, design drivers, principles, constraints,
dependencies, sequences, database design, and traceability.

TaskFlow uses a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns: React SPA frontend, Node.js REST API, and PostgreSQL database. WebSocket connections enable real-time updates for collaborative task management.

The architecture prioritizes simplicity and developer productivity while supporting real-time collaboration. System boundaries are clearly defined between presentation, business logic, and data persistence layers.

### Architecture drivers

#### Product requirements

##### Task Management

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-ex-task-flow-fr-task-management`

**Solution**: REST API with idempotent endpoints and PostgreSQL persistence for task CRUD.

##### Notifications

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-ex-task-flow-fr-notifications`

**Solution**: WebSocket push with Redis PubSub for real-time notification delivery.

##### Security

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-ex-task-flow-nfr-security`

**Solution**: JWT authentication with role-based authorization middleware.

##### Performance

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-ex-task-flow-nfr-performance`

**Solution**: Connection pooling and query optimization for sub-500ms responses.

#### Architecture Decisions Records

##### PostgreSQL for Storage

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-ex-task-flow-adr-postgres-storage`

Use PostgreSQL for durable task storage. Chosen for strong ACID guarantees, relational query support, and team expertise. Trade-off: requires separate DB server vs embedded SQLite.

Prefer architectures that keep task state and notifications consistent and observable for all users. Changes should propagate to all connected clients within 2 seconds.

#### Simplicity over Specs
