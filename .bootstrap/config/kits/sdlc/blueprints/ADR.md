# ADR Blueprint
Blueprint for Architecture Decision Records (ADR).

This file is the single source of truth for:
- template.md generation (from @cpt:heading + @cpt:prompt markers)
- example.md generation (from @cpt:heading examples + @cpt:example markers)
- rules.md generation (from @cpt:rules + @cpt:rule markers)
- checklist.md generation (from @cpt:checklist + @cpt:check markers)
- constraints.toml contributions (from @cpt:heading + @cpt:id markers)

All text between markers is ignored by the generator — it serves as
human-readable documentation for anyone editing this blueprint.

Based on: Michael Nygard's ADR template (2011), ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

## Metadata

> **`@cpt:blueprint`** — Blueprint metadata: artifact kind, kit slug, version. Internal; not output to any file.

`@cpt:blueprint`
```toml
# Artifact kind: PRD | ADR | DESIGN | DECOMPOSITION | FEATURE | CODE
artifact = "ADR"
codebase = false
template_frontmatter = """
status: accepted
date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
decision-makers: {optionally fill decision makers names, accounts or remove that field}"""
example_frontmatter = """
status: accepted
date: 2026-02-16"""
```

## Skill Integration

Commands and workflows exposed to AI agents for ADR operations.

> **`@cpt:skill`** — Skill content. Agent-facing navigation and instructions. Output: `.gen/kits/{slug}/SKILL.md`.

`@cpt:skill`
```markdown
### ADR Commands
- `cypilot validate --artifact <ADR.md>` — validate ADR structure and IDs
- `cypilot list-ids --kind adr` — list all ADRs
- `cypilot where-defined --id <id>` — find where an ADR ID is defined
- `cypilot where-used --id <id>` — find where an ADR ID is referenced in DESIGN
### ADR Workflows
- **Generate ADR**: create a new ADR from template with guided prompts per section
- **Analyze ADR**: validate structure (deterministic) then semantic quality (checklist-based)
```
`@/cpt:skill`

## Rules Definition

Rules are organized into sections that map to the generated `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.
The `@cpt:rules` skeleton defines the section structure; individual `@cpt:rule`
markers provide the content for each section.

### Rules Skeleton

> **`@cpt:rules`** — Rules skeleton. Defines section structure (prerequisites, requirements, tasks, validation, etc.) for `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rules`
```toml
# Prerequisite steps (load dependencies, read configs)
[prerequisites]
# Ordered list of section keys (each needs a matching @cpt:rule block)
sections = ["load_dependencies"]

# Requirement sections (structural, semantic, constraints, etc.)
[requirements]
# Ordered list of section keys (each needs a matching @cpt:rule block)
sections = ["structural", "versioning", "semantic", "scope", "status_traceability", "constraints", "deliberate_omissions", "writing_quality"]
# Display names for non-obvious requirement section keys
[requirements.names]
deliberate_omissions = "Deliberate Omissions (MUST NOT HAVE)"
writing_quality = "ADR Writing Quality"

# Task phases — step-by-step workflow for creating the artifact
[tasks]
# Ordered list of phase keys (each needs a matching @cpt:rule block)
phases = ["setup", "content_creation", "ids_and_structure", "quality_check"]
# Display names for non-obvious task phase keys
[tasks.names]
ids_and_structure = "IDs and Structure"

# Validation phases — ordered checks run after artifact is written
[validation]
# Ordered list of phase keys (each needs a matching @cpt:rule block)
phases = ["structural", "semantic", "validation_report", "applicability", "review_scope", "report_format", "reporting", "pr_review"]
# Display names for non-obvious validation phase keys
[validation.names]
structural = "Structural Validation (Deterministic)"
semantic = "Semantic Validation (Checklist-based)"
applicability = "Applicability Context"
review_scope = "Review Scope Selection"
report_format = "Report Format"
reporting = "Reporting Commitment"
pr_review = "PR Review Focus (ADR)"

# Error handling sections — what to do when things go wrong
[error_handling]
# Ordered list of section keys (each needs a matching @cpt:rule block)
sections = ["number_conflict", "missing_directory", "escalation"]

# Next steps — recommended actions after completing the artifact
[next_steps]
# Ordered list of section keys (each needs a matching @cpt:rule block)
sections = ["options"]
```

### Requirements

Structural and semantic rules that every ADR must satisfy.

#### Structural Requirements

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-structural`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "structural"
```
```markdown
- [ ] ADR follows `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/template.md` structure
- [ ] Artifact frontmatter is required
- [ ] ADR has unique ID: `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-adr-{slug}` (e.g., `cpt-myapp-adr-use-postgresql`)
- [ ] ID has priority marker (`p1`-`p9`)
- [ ] No placeholder content (TODO, TBD, FIXME)
- [ ] No duplicate IDs
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-structural`

#### Versioning Rules

ADR immutability and supersession policy.

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-versioning`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "versioning"
```
```markdown
- [ ] ADR version in filename: `NNNN-{slug}-v{N}.md`
- [ ] When PROPOSED: minor edits allowed without version change
- [ ] When ACCEPTED: **immutable** — do NOT edit decision/rationale
- [ ] To change accepted decision: create NEW ADR with SUPERSEDES reference
- [ ] Superseding ADR: `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-adr-{new-slug}` with status SUPERSEDED on original
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-versioning`

#### Semantic Quality

Content quality standards for ADR sections.

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-semantic`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "semantic"
```
```markdown
**Reference**: `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/checklist.md` for detailed criteria

- [ ] Problem/context clearly stated
- [ ] At least 2-3 options considered
- [ ] Decision rationale explained
- [ ] Consequences documented (pros and cons)
- [ ] Valid status (PROPOSED, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, DEPRECATED, SUPERSEDED)
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-semantic`

#### Decision Scope

Guidelines for what constitutes an ADR-worthy decision.

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-scope`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "scope"
```
```markdown
**One ADR per decision**. Avoid bundling multiple decisions.

| Scope | Examples | Guideline |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Too broad** | "Use microservices and React and PostgreSQL" | Split into separate ADRs |
| **Right size** | "Use PostgreSQL for persistent storage" | Single architectural choice |
| **Too narrow** | "Use VARCHAR(255) for email field" | Implementation detail, not ADR-worthy |

**ADR-worthy decisions**:
- Technology choices (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Architectural patterns (monolith vs microservices, event-driven)
- Integration approaches (REST vs GraphQL, sync vs async)
- Security strategies (auth mechanisms, encryption approaches)
- Infrastructure decisions (cloud provider, deployment model)

**NOT ADR-worthy** (handle in code/design docs):
- Variable naming conventions
- File organization within modules
- Specific library versions (unless security-critical)
- UI component styling choices
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-scope`

#### Status & Traceability

Valid statuses and transition rules for ADR lifecycle.

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-status_traceability`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "status_traceability"
```
```markdown
**Valid Statuses**: PROPOSED, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, DEPRECATED, SUPERSEDED

**Status Transitions**:

| From | To | Trigger | Action |
|------|-----|---------|--------|
| PROPOSED | ACCEPTED | Decision approved | Update status, begin implementation |
| PROPOSED | REJECTED | Decision declined | Update status, document rejection reason |
| ACCEPTED | DEPRECATED | Decision no longer applies | Update status, note why |
| ACCEPTED | SUPERSEDED | Replaced by new ADR | Update status, add `superseded_by` reference |

**Status Change Procedure**:

1. **Locate ADR file**: `architecture/ADR/NNNN-{slug}.md`
2. **Update frontmatter status**: Change `status: {OLD}` → `status: {NEW}`
3. **Add status history** (if present): Append `{date}: {OLD} → {NEW} ({reason})`
4. **For SUPERSEDED**: Add `superseded_by: cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-adr-{new-slug}`
5. **For REJECTED**: Add `rejection_reason: {brief explanation}`

**REJECTED Status**:

Use when:
- Decision was reviewed but not approved
- Alternative approach was chosen (document which)
- Requirements changed before acceptance

Keep REJECTED ADRs for historical record — do not delete.
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-status_traceability`

#### Constraints Integration

How ADR relates to kit-level constraints validation.

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-constraints`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "constraints"
```
```markdown
- [ ] ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/constraints.toml` (kit root)
- [ ] Treat `constraints.toml` as primary validator for:
  - where IDs are defined
  - where IDs are referenced
  - which cross-artifact references are required / optional / prohibited

**References**:
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/requirements/kit-constraints.md`
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/schemas/kit-constraints.schema.json`

**Validation Checks**:
- `cypilot validate` enforces `identifiers[<kind>].references` rules for ADR coverage in DESIGN
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-constraints`

#### Deliberate Omissions (MUST NOT HAVE)

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-deliberate_omissions`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "deliberate_omissions"
```
```markdown
ADRs must NOT contain the following — report as violation if found:

- **ARCH-ADR-NO-001**: No Complete Architecture Description (CRITICAL) — ADR is a decision record, not an architecture document
- **ARCH-ADR-NO-002**: No Spec Implementation Details (HIGH) — ADR captures *why*, not *how* to implement
- **BIZ-ADR-NO-001**: No Product Requirements (HIGH) — requirements belong in PRD
- **BIZ-ADR-NO-002**: No Implementation Tasks (HIGH) — tasks belong in DECOMPOSITION/FEATURE
- **DATA-ADR-NO-001**: No Complete Schema Definitions (MEDIUM) — schemas belong in DESIGN
- **MAINT-ADR-NO-001**: No Code Implementation (HIGH) — code belongs in implementation
- **SEC-ADR-NO-001**: No Security Secrets (CRITICAL) — secrets must never appear in documentation
- **TEST-ADR-NO-001**: No Test Implementation (MEDIUM) — tests belong in code
- **OPS-ADR-NO-001**: No Operational Procedures (MEDIUM) — procedures belong in runbooks
- **ARCH-ADR-NO-003**: No Trivial Decisions (MEDIUM) — ADRs are for significant decisions only
- **ARCH-ADR-NO-004**: No Incomplete Decisions (HIGH) — ADR must have a clear decision, not "TBD"
```

### Task Phases

Step-by-step workflow for creating an ADR.

#### Setup

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:tasks-setup`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "tasks"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "setup"
```
```markdown
- [ ] Load `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/template.md` for structure
- [ ] Load `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/checklist.md` for semantic guidance
- [ ] Load `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/examples/example.md` for reference style
- [ ] Read `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml` to determine ADR directory
- [ ] Determine next ADR number (ADR-NNNN)

**ADR path resolution**:
1. List existing ADRs from `artifacts` array where `kind: "ADR"`
2. For new ADR, derive default path:
   - Read system's `artifacts_dir` from `artifacts.toml` (default: `architecture`)
   - Use kit's default subdirectory for ADRs: `ADR/`
   - Create at: `{artifacts_dir}/ADR/{NNNN}-{slug}.md`
3. Register new ADR in `artifacts.toml` with FULL path

**ADR Number Assignment**:

1. List existing ADRs from `artifacts` array where `kind: "ADR"`
2. Extract highest number: parse `NNNN` from filenames
3. Assign next sequential: `NNNN + 1`
```
`@/cpt:rule:tasks-setup`

#### Content Creation

```
```markdown
**Use example as reference:**

| Section | Example Reference | Checklist Guidance |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Context | How example states problem | ADR-001: Context Clarity |
| Options | How example lists alternatives | ADR-002: Options Analysis |
| Decision | How example explains choice | ADR-003: Decision Rationale |

#### Applicability Context

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:validation-applicability`

# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "validation"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "applicability"
```
```markdown
Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the artifact's domain** — What kind of system/project is this ADR for? (e.g., CLI tool, web service, data pipeline, methodology framework)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all ADRs:
   - A CLI tool ADR may not need Security Impact analysis
   - A methodology framework ADR may not need Performance Impact analysis
   - A local development tool ADR may not need Operational Readiness analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it's not mentioned. Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

For each major checklist category (ARCH, PERF, SEC, REL, DATA, INT, OPS, MAINT, TEST, COMPL, UX, BIZ), confirm:

- [ ] Category is addressed in the document, OR
- [ ] Category is explicitly marked "Not applicable" with reasoning in the document, OR
- [ ] Category absence is reported as a violation (with applicability justification)
```

#### Review Scope Selection

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:validation-review_scope`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "validation"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "review_scope"
```
```markdown
Select review depth based on ADR complexity and impact:

| ADR Type | Review Mode | Domains to Check |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Simple (single component, low risk) | **Quick** | ARCH only |
| Standard (multi-component, moderate risk) | **Standard** | ARCH + relevant domains |
| Complex (architectural, high risk) | **Full** | All applicable domains |

**Quick Review (ARCH Only)** — For simple, low-risk decisions:
- ARCH-ADR-001 through ARCH-ADR-006, QUALITY-002, QUALITY-003
- Skip all domain-specific sections (PERF, SEC, REL, etc.)

**Standard Review** — Select domains by ADR subject:

| ADR Subject | Required Domains |
|-------------|------------------|
| Technology choice | ARCH, MAINT, OPS |
| Security mechanism | ARCH, SEC, COMPL |
| Database/storage | ARCH, DATA, PERF |
| API/integration | ARCH, INT, SEC |
| Infrastructure | ARCH, OPS, REL, PERF |
| User-facing spec | ARCH, UX, BIZ |

**Full Review** — All applicable domains.

**Domain Applicability Quick Reference**:

| Domain | When Required | When N/A |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| PERF | Performance-sensitive systems | Methodology, documentation |
| SEC | User data, network, auth | Local-only tools |
| REL | Production systems, SLAs | Dev tools, prototypes |
| DATA | Persistent storage, migrations | Stateless components |

```
```markdown
- [ ] I reported all issues I found
- [ ] I used the exact report format defined in this checklist (no deviations)
- [ ] I included Why Applicable justification for each issue
- [ ] I included evidence and impact for each issue
- [ ] I proposed concrete fixes for each issue
- [ ] I did not hide or omit known problems
- [ ] I verified explicit handling for all major checklist categories

#### PR Review Focus (ADR)

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:validation-pr_review`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "validation"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "pr_review"
```
```markdown
When reviewing PRs that add or change Architecture Decision Records, additionally focus on:

- [ ] Ensure the problem is module/system scoped, not generic and repeatable
- [ ] Compliance with `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/template.md` structure (generated from blueprint)
- [ ] Ensure the problem is not already solved by other existing ADRs in the project ADR directory (see `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml` for path)
- [ ] Alternatives are genuinely different approaches (not straw men)
- [ ] Decision rationale is concrete and traceable to project constraints
```

## Checklist Definition

The `@cpt:checklist` defines severity levels and review domains.
Each `@cpt:check` is an individual checklist item grouped by domain.

Domains are prioritized: ARCH → SEC → BIZ are reviewed first.
Check severity: CRITICAL items block acceptance; HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW are advisory.

### Checklist Skeleton

> **`@cpt:checklist`** — Checklist preamble. Static markdown placed at the top of `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/checklist.md` (standards, prerequisites, severity dictionary).

# ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Expert Checklist

**Artifact**: Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
**Version**: 2.0
**Purpose**: Comprehensive quality checklist for ADR artifacts

---

## Referenced Standards

This checklist incorporates requirements and best practices from:

| Standard | Scope | Key Sections Used |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Michael Nygard's ADR Template (2011)** | De facto standard for ADR format | Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences structure |
| **ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022** | Architecture Description | §5.7 AD elements, §6.7 Architecture decisions and rationale |
| **ISO/IEC 25010:2011** | SQuaRE Software Quality Model | §4.2 Quality characteristics (performance, security, reliability, maintainability) |
| **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** | Requirements Engineering | §6.5 Behavioral requirements, traceability |
| **OWASP ASVS 5.0** | Application Security Verification | V1.2 Architecture, V2 Authentication, V5 Validation |
| **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** | Information Security Management | Annex A controls, risk assessment |
| **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2021** | Test Documentation | Test specification, acceptance criteria |
---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates ADR artifacts
- [ ] I will follow the Applicability Context rules below
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] I will complete the Final Checklist and provide a review report

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the artifact's domain** — What kind of system/project is this ADR for? (e.g., CLI tool, web service, data pipeline, methodology framework)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all ADRs:
   - A CLI tool ADR may not need Security Impact analysis
   - A methodology framework ADR may not need Performance Impact analysis
   - A local development tool ADR may not need Operational Readiness analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it's not mentioned. Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Unsafe/misleading/unverifiable; blocks downstream work.
- **HIGH**: Major ambiguity/risk; should be fixed before approval.
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

---

## Review Scope Selection

Select review depth based on ADR complexity and impact:

### Review Modes

| ADR Type | Review Mode | Domains to Check |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Simple (single component, low risk) | **Quick** | ARCH only |
| Standard (multi-component, moderate risk) | **Standard** | ARCH + relevant domains |
| Complex (architectural, high risk) | **Full** | All applicable domains |

### Quick Review (ARCH Only)

For simple, low-risk decisions, check only core architecture items:

**MUST CHECK**:
- [ ] ARCH-ADR-001: Decision Significance
- [ ] ARCH-ADR-002: Context Completeness
- [ ] ARCH-ADR-003: Options Quality
- [ ] ARCH-ADR-004: Decision Rationale
- [ ] ARCH-ADR-006: ADR Metadata Quality
- [ ] QUALITY-002: Clarity
- [ ] QUALITY-003: Actionability

**SKIP**: All domain-specific sections (PERF, SEC, REL, etc.)

Note: `Quick review: checked ARCH core items only`

### Standard Review (ARCH + Relevant Domains)

Select applicable domains based on ADR subject:

| ADR Subject | Required Domains |
|-------------|------------------|
| Technology choice | ARCH, MAINT, OPS |
| Security mechanism | ARCH, SEC, COMPL |
| Database/storage | ARCH, DATA, PERF |
| API/integration | ARCH, INT, SEC |
| Infrastructure | ARCH, OPS, REL, PERF |
| User-facing spec | ARCH, UX, BIZ |

### Full Review

For architectural decisions with broad impact, check ALL applicable domains.

### Domain Applicability Quick Reference

| Domain | When Required | When N/A |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **PERF** | Performance-sensitive systems | Methodology, documentation |
| **SEC** | User data, network, auth | Local-only tools |
| **REL** | Production systems, SLAs | Dev tools, prototypes |
| **DATA** | Persistent storage, migrations | Stateless components |
| **INT** | External APIs, contracts | Self-contained systems |
| **OPS** | Deployed services | Libraries, frameworks |
| **MAINT** | Long-lived code | Throwaway prototypes |
| **TEST** | Quality-critical systems | Exploratory work |
| **COMPL** | Regulated industries | Internal tools |
| **UX** | End-user impact | Backend infrastructure |
| **BIZ** | Business alignment needed | Technical decisions |

## Template Structure

Headings, prompts, IDs, and examples that define the generated `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/template.md`
and `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/examples/example.md` files.

Each `@cpt:heading` defines a section in the template with its level, numbering,
and pattern for validation. `@cpt:prompt` provides the placeholder content that
appears in the generated template. `@cpt:example` provides example content.
`@cpt:id` defines identifier schemas used in those sections.
