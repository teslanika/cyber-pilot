# FEATURE Blueprint
Blueprint for Feature Specification Documents.

This file is the single source of truth for:
- template.md generation (from @cpt:heading + @cpt:prompt markers)
- example.md generation (from @cpt:heading examples + @cpt:example markers)
- rules.md generation (from @cpt:rules + @cpt:rule markers)
- checklist.md generation (from @cpt:checklist + @cpt:check markers)
- constraints.toml contributions (from @cpt:heading + @cpt:id markers)

All text between markers is ignored by the generator.

FEATURE defines precise behavior using CDSL (Context-Driven Specification
Language): actor flows, processes/algorithms, state machines, definitions
of done, and acceptance criteria.

# Artifact kind: PRD | ADR | DESIGN | DECOMPOSITION | FEATURE | CODE
artifact = "FEATURE"
codebase = false
```

### FEATURE Commands
- `cypilot validate --artifact <FEATURE.md>` — validate FEATURE structure and IDs
- `cypilot list-ids --kind flow` — list all flows
- `cypilot list-ids --kind algo` — list all algorithms
- `cypilot list-ids --kind state` — list all state machines
- `cypilot list-ids --kind dod` — list all definitions of done
- `cypilot where-defined --id <id>` — find where a FEATURE ID is defined
- `cypilot where-used --id <id>` — find where a FEATURE ID is referenced in code
### FEATURE Workflows
- **Generate FEATURE**: create a new FEATURE from template with guided CDSL prompts
- **Analyze FEATURE**: validate structure (deterministic) then semantic quality (checklist-based)
```

# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "semantic"
```
```markdown
**Reference**: `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/checklist.md` for detailed criteria

- [ ] Actor flows define complete user journeys
- [ ] Algorithms specify processing logic clearly
- [ ] State machines capture all valid transitions
- [ ] DoD items are testable and traceable
- [ ] CDSL instructions describe "what" not "how"
- [ ] Control flow keywords used correctly (IF, RETURN, FROM/TO/WHEN)
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-semantic`

#### Traceability

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-traceability`
```toml

kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "traceability"

- [ ] Code must contain markers: `@cpt-{kind}:{cpt-id}:p{N}`
- [ ] Each CDSL instruction maps to code marker
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-traceability`

#### Constraints

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-constraints`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "constraints"
```
```markdown
- [ ] ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/constraints.toml` (kit root)
- [ ] Treat `constraints.toml` as primary validator for:
  - where IDs are defined
  - where IDs are referenced
  - which cross-artifact references are required / optional / prohibited

**References**:
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/requirements/kit-constraints.md`
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/schemas/kit-constraints.schema.json`

**Validation Checks**:
- `cypilot validate` enforces `identifiers[<kind>].references` rules (required / optional / prohibited)
- `cypilot validate` enforces headings scoping for ID definitions and references
- `cypilot validate` enforces "checked ref implies checked def" consistency
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-constraints`

#### Scope

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-scope`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "scope"
```
```markdown
**One FEATURE per feature from DECOMPOSITION manifest**. Match scope to implementation unit.

| Scope | Examples | Guideline |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Too broad** | "User management feature" covering auth, profiles, roles | Split into separate FEATUREs |
| **Right size** | "User login flow" covering single capability | Clear boundary, implementable unit |
| **Too narrow** | "Validate email format" | Implementation detail, belongs in flow/algo |

**FEATURE-worthy content**:
- Actor flows (complete user journeys)
- Algorithms (processing logic)
- State machines (entity lifecycle)
- DoD items / acceptance criteria
- Test scenarios

**NOT FEATURE-worthy** (use other artifacts):
- System architecture → DESIGN
- Technology decisions → ADR
- Business requirements → PRD
- Multiple unrelated capabilities → Split into FEATUREs

**Relationship to other artifacts**:
- **DECOMPOSITION** → FEATURE: DECOMPOSITION lists what to build, FEATURE details implementable behavior
- **DESIGN** → FEATURE: DESIGN provides architecture context, FEATURE details implementable behavior
- **FEATURE** → CODE: FEATURE defines behavior, CODE implements with traceability markers
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-scope`

#### Upstream Traceability

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-upstream_traceability`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "upstream_traceability"
```
```markdown
- [ ] When all flows/algorithms/states/DoD items `[x]` → mark feature as `[x]` in DECOMPOSITION
- [ ] When feature complete → update status in DECOMPOSITION (→ IMPLEMENTED)
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-upstream_traceability`

#### Feature Status

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-featstatus`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "featstatus"
```
```markdown
- [ ] FEATURE defines a `featstatus` ID definition directly under the H1 title (before `## Feature Context`)
- [ ] Template: `cpt-{system}-featstatus-{feature-slug}`
- [ ] The `featstatus` checkbox MUST be consistent with all task-tracked items within its scope:
  - If `featstatus` is `[x]` then ALL nested task-tracked ID definitions AND ALL task-checkbox references within its content MUST be `[x]`
  - If ALL nested task-tracked ID definitions AND ALL task-checkbox references within its content are `[x]` then `featstatus` MUST be `[x]`
- [ ] `featstatus` is a documentation/status rollup marker (it is not a `to_code` identifier kind)
```
`@/cpt:rule:requirements-featstatus`

#### Checkbox Management

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:requirements-checkbox_management`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "requirements"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "checkbox_management"
```
```markdown
**Quick Reference**: Check FEATURE element when ALL code markers for that element exist and implementation verified.

| ID kind | `to_code` | Check when... |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| `flow` | `true` | ALL `@cpt-flow:cpt-{system}-flow-{feature-slug}-{slug}:p{N}` markers exist in code |
| `algo` | `true` | ALL `@cpt-algo:cpt-{system}-algo-{feature-slug}-{slug}:p{N}` markers exist in code |
| `state` | `true` | ALL `@cpt-state:cpt-{system}-state-{feature-slug}-{slug}:p{N}` markers exist in code |
| `dod` | `true` | Implementation complete AND tests pass |

**Detailed Rules**:

| Kind | `to_code` | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `flow` | `true` | Flow is checked when code markers exist and implementation verified |
| `algo` | `true` | Algorithm is checked when code markers exist and implementation verified |
| `state` | `true` | State machine is checked when code markers exist and implementation verified |
| `dod` | `true` | DoD item is checked when implementation complete and tests pass |

**Checkbox States**:
1. **Flow Checkbox** (kind: `flow`):
   - `[ ] **ID**: cpt-{system}-flow-{feature-slug}-{slug}` — unchecked until implemented
   - `[x] **ID**: cpt-{system}-flow-{feature-slug}-{slug}` — checked when ALL code markers exist
2. **Algorithm Checkbox** (kind: `algo`):
   - `[ ] **ID**: cpt-{system}-algo-{feature-slug}-{slug}` — unchecked until implemented
   - `[x] **ID**: cpt-{system}-algo-{feature-slug}-{slug}` — checked when ALL code markers exist
3. **State Machine Checkbox** (kind: `state`):
   - `[ ] **ID**: cpt-{system}-state-{feature-slug}-{slug}` — unchecked until implemented
   - `[x] **ID**: cpt-{system}-state-{feature-slug}-{slug}` — checked when ALL code markers exist
4. **DoD Checkbox** (kind: `dod`):
   - `[ ] p1 - cpt-{system}-dod-{feature-slug}-{slug}` — unchecked until satisfied
   - `[x] p1 - cpt-{system}-dod-{feature-slug}-{slug}` — checked when implementation complete and tests pass

**When to Update Upstream Artifacts**:
- [ ] When `flow` is checked → verify all CDSL instructions have code markers
- [ ] When `algo` is checked → verify algorithm logic is implemented
- [ ] When `state` is checked → verify all transitions are implemented
- [ ] When `dod` is checked → verify requirement is satisfied and tested
- [ ] When ALL defined IDs in FEATURE are `[x]` → mark feature as complete in DECOMPOSITION
- [ ] When feature is `[x]` → update upstream references in DECOMPOSITION (which cascades to PRD/DESIGN)

**Validation Checks**:
- `cypilot validate` will warn if `to_code="true"` ID has no code markers
- `cypilot validate` will warn if a reference points to a non-existent ID
- `cypilot validate` will report code coverage: N% of CDSL instructions have markers

**Cross-Artifact References**:

| Reference Type | Source Artifact | Purpose |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Parent feature ID | DECOMPOSITION | Links to parent feature in manifest |
| Actor ID (`cpt-{system}-actor-{slug}`) | PRD | Identifies actors involved in flows |
| FR ID (`cpt-{system}-fr-{slug}`) | PRD | Covers functional requirement |
| NFR ID (`cpt-{system}-nfr-{slug}`) | PRD | Covers non-functional requirement |
| Principle ID (`cpt-{system}-principle-{slug}`) | DESIGN | Applies design principle |
| Constraint ID (`cpt-{system}-constraint-{slug}`) | DESIGN | Satisfies design constraint |
| Component ID (`cpt-{system}-component-{slug}`) | DESIGN | Uses design component |
| Sequence ID (`cpt-{system}-seq-{slug}`) | DESIGN | Implements sequence diagram |
| Data ID (`cpt-{system}-dbtable-{slug}`) | DESIGN | Uses database table |
```

- **BIZ-FDESIGN-NO-001**: No Product Requirements (HIGH) — requirements belong in PRD
- **BIZ-FDESIGN-NO-002**: No Sprint/Task Breakdowns (HIGH) — tasks belong in DECOMPOSITION
- **MAINT-FDESIGN-NO-001**: No Code Snippets (HIGH) — code belongs in implementation
- **TEST-FDESIGN-NO-001**: No Test Implementation (MEDIUM) — test code belongs in implementation
- **SEC-FDESIGN-NO-001**: No Security Secrets (CRITICAL) — secrets must never appear in documentation

#### Applicability Context

> **`@cpt:rule`** — Rule entry. TOML selects category+section; markdown block becomes the section body in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rule:validation-applicability`
```toml
# Rule category: prerequisites | requirements | tasks | validation | error_handling | next_steps
kind = "validation"
# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "applicability"
```
```markdown
Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the feature's domain** — What kind of feature is this? (e.g., user-facing UI feature, backend API feature, data processing pipeline, CLI command)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all features:
   - A simple CRUD feature may not need complex State Management analysis
   - A read-only feature may not need Data Integrity analysis
   - A CLI feature may not need UI/UX analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"
```

# Section name — must match a section defined in the @cpt:rules skeleton
section = "report_format"
```
````markdown
Report **only** problems (do not list what is OK).

For each issue include:

- **Why Applicable**: Explain why this requirement applies to this specific feature's context (e.g., "This feature handles user authentication, therefore security analysis is required")
- **Checklist Item**: `{CHECKLIST-ID}` — {Checklist item title}
- **Severity**: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW
- **Issue**: What is wrong (requirement missing or incomplete)
- **Evidence**: Quote the exact text or "No mention found"
- **Why it matters**: Impact (risk, cost, user harm, compliance)
- **Proposal**: Concrete fix with clear acceptance criteria

# FEATURE Expert Checklist

**Artifact**: Feature (FEATURE)
**Version**: 2.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03
**Purpose**: Comprehensive quality checklist for FEATURE artifacts

---

## Referenced Standards

This checklist validates FEATURE artifacts based on the following international standards:

| Standard | Domain | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [IEEE 1016-2009](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1016/4502/) | **Design Description** | Software Design Descriptions — detailed design viewpoint, design entities |
| [ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/72089.html) | **Requirements Notation** | Requirements engineering — behavioral requirements, shall notation, traceability |
| [ISO/IEC 25010:2011](https://www.iso.org/standard/35733.html) | **Quality Model** | SQuaRE — 8 quality characteristics: performance, security, reliability, maintainability |
| [ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2021](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) | **Test Documentation** | Software testing — test specification, acceptance criteria |
| [OWASP ASVS 5.0](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) | **Security Verification** | Application security requirements — authentication, authorization, input validation |
| [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) | **Accessibility** | Web Content Accessibility Guidelines — POUR principles, Level AA |
---

## Review Scope Selection

**Choose review mode based on feature complexity and risk**:

| Review Mode | When to Use | Domains to Check |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Quick** | Simple CRUD, minor updates | ARCH (core) + BIZ + changed domains |
| **Standard** | New feature, moderate complexity | All applicable domains |
| **Full** | Security-sensitive, complex logic | All 12 domains with evidence |

### Quick Review (Core Items Only)

**MUST CHECK** (blocking):
- [ ] ARCH-FDESIGN-001: Feature Context Completeness
- [ ] ARCH-FDESIGN-003: Actor Flow Completeness
- [ ] BIZ-FDESIGN-001: Requirements Alignment
- [ ] DOC-FDESIGN-001: Explicit Non-Applicability

**Changed sections** — also check relevant domain items for any sections modified.

### Domain Prioritization by Feature Type

| Feature Type | Priority Domains (check first) | Secondary Domains | Often N/A |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **User-facing UI** | ARCH, UX, SEC, TEST | PERF, REL, DATA | OPS, INT, COMPL |
| **Backend API** | ARCH, SEC, DATA, INT | PERF, REL, TEST | UX, COMPL |
| **Data Processing** | ARCH, DATA, PERF, REL | INT, TEST | SEC, UX, OPS, COMPL |
| **CLI Command** | ARCH, MAINT, TEST | DATA, INT | SEC, PERF, UX, OPS, COMPL |
| **Integration/Webhook** | ARCH, INT, SEC, REL | DATA, TEST | UX, PERF, OPS, COMPL |
| **Auth/Security** | SEC, ARCH, DATA, REL | TEST, COMPL | UX, PERF, OPS, INT |

**Applicability Rule**: Domains in "Often N/A" column still require explicit "Not applicable because..." statement in document if skipped.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates FEATURE artifacts
- [ ] I will follow the Applicability Context rules below
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] I will complete the Final Checklist and provide a review report

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the feature's domain** — What kind of feature is this? (e.g., user-facing UI feature, backend API feature, data processing pipeline, CLI command)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all features:
   - A simple CRUD feature may not need complex State Management analysis
   - A read-only feature may not need Data Integrity analysis
   - A CLI feature may not need UI/UX analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it's not mentioned. Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Unsafe/misleading/unverifiable; blocks downstream work.
- **HIGH**: Major ambiguity/risk; should be fixed before approval.
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

## Template Structure

Headings, prompts, IDs, and examples that define the generated `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/template.md`
and `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/examples/example.md` files. The FEATURE template covers: context (overview,
purpose, actors, references), actor flows with CDSL instructions, processes/
algorithms, state machines, definitions of done, and acceptance criteria.

Core task management functionality for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. This feature provides the foundation for team collaboration by enabling users to track work items through their lifecycle.

Problem: Teams need a central place to track tasks with status, priority, and assignments.
Primary value: Enables organized task tracking with clear ownership.
Key assumptions: Users have accounts and belong to at least one team.

### Task Creation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-ex-task-flow-dod-task-create`

Users can create tasks with title, description, priority, and due date. The system validates input and stores the task with BACKLOG status.

**Implementation details**:
- API: `POST /api/tasks` with JSON body `{title, description, priority, due_date}`
- DB: insert into `tasks` table (columns: title, description, priority, due_date, status)
- Domain: `Task` entity (id, title, description, priority, due_date, status)

**Implements**:
- `cpt-ex-task-flow-flow-create-task`
- `cpt-ex-task-flow-algo-validate-task`

**Covers (PRD)**:
- `cpt-ex-task-flow-fr-task-management`
- `cpt-ex-task-flow-nfr-performance`

**Covers (DESIGN)**:
- `cpt-ex-task-flow-principle-realtime-first`
- `cpt-ex-task-flow-constraint-supported-platforms`

`@cpt:example:feature-acceptance-criteria`
```markdown
- [ ] The feature supports task creation and assignment flow end-to-end
- [ ] Validation rules reject invalid titles, priorities, and past due dates
- [ ] State transitions follow the Task Status state machine

## Additional Context (optional)

The feature must keep task status transitions consistent with the Task Status state machine in Section D. All state changes should emit events for the notification system.
