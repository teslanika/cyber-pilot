# DECOMPOSITION Blueprint
Blueprint for Decomposition Plans.

This file is the single source of truth for:
- template.md generation (from @cpt:heading + @cpt:prompt markers)
- example.md generation (from @cpt:heading examples + @cpt:example markers)
- rules.md generation (from @cpt:rules + @cpt:rule markers)
- checklist.md generation (from @cpt:checklist + @cpt:check markers)
- constraints.toml contributions (from @cpt:heading + @cpt:id markers)

All text between markers is ignored by the generator — it serves as
human-readable documentation for anyone editing this blueprint.

DECOMPOSITION bridges DESIGN → FEATURE by listing features, ordering,
dependencies, and traceability to PRD/DESIGN.

## Metadata

> **`@cpt:blueprint`** — Blueprint metadata: artifact kind, kit slug, version. Internal; not output to any file.

`@cpt:blueprint`
```toml
# Artifact kind: PRD | ADR | DESIGN | DECOMPOSITION | FEATURE | CODE
artifact = "DECOMPOSITION"
codebase = false
```
`@/cpt:blueprint`

## Skill Integration

> **`@cpt:skill`** — Skill content. Agent-facing navigation and instructions. Output: `.gen/kits/{slug}/SKILL.md`.

### DECOMPOSITION Commands
- `cypilot validate --artifact <DECOMPOSITION.md>` — validate DECOMPOSITION structure and IDs
- `cypilot list-ids --kind feature` — list all features
- `cypilot list-ids --kind status` — list status indicators
- `cypilot where-defined --id <id>` — find where a feature ID is defined
- `cypilot where-used --id <id>` — find where a feature ID is referenced in FEATURE artifacts
### DECOMPOSITION Workflows
- **Generate DECOMPOSITION**: create feature manifest from DESIGN with guided prompts
- **Analyze DECOMPOSITION**: validate structure (deterministic) then decomposition quality (checklist-based)
```

```
```markdown
**Defined IDs (from `constraints.toml`)**:
- **Kind**: `status` — `[ ] p1 - **ID**: cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-status-overall` — checked when ALL features checked
- **Kind**: `feature` — `[ ] p1 - **ID**: cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-feature-{slug}` — checked when FEATURE spec complete

- Any `cpt-...` occurrences outside an `**ID**` definition line are references
- Common reference kinds: `fr`, `nfr`, `principle`, `constraint`, `component`, `seq`, `dbtable`

**Progress / Cascade Rules**:

```markdown
- [ ] ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/constraints.toml` (kit root)
- [ ] Treat `constraints.toml` as primary validator for:
  - where IDs are defined
  - where IDs are referenced
  - which cross-artifact references are required / optional / prohibited

**References**:
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/requirements/kit-constraints.md`

**Validation Checks**:
- `cypilot validate` enforces `identifiers[<kind>].references` rules (required / optional / prohibited)
- `cypilot validate` enforces headings scoping for ID definitions and references
- `cypilot validate` enforces "checked ref implies checked def" consistency

**Initial Creation (New Feature)**:
1. Create feature entry with `[ ]` unchecked on the feature ID
2. Add all reference blocks with `[ ]` unchecked on each referenced ID
3. Overall `status-overall` remains `[ ]` unchecked

**During Implementation (Marking Progress)**:
1. When a specific requirement is implemented: find the referenced ID entry, change `[ ]` to `[x]`
2. When a component is integrated: find the referenced component entry, change `[ ]` to `[x]`
3. Continue for all reference types as work progresses

**Feature Completion (Marking Feature Done)**:
1. Verify ALL referenced IDs within the feature entry have `[x]`
2. Run `cypilot validate` to confirm no checkbox inconsistencies
3. Change the feature ID line from `[ ]` to `[x]`
4. Update feature status emoji (e.g., ⏳ → ✅)

**Manifest Completion (Marking Overall Done)**:
1. Verify ALL feature entries have `[x]`
2. Run `cypilot validate` to confirm cascade consistency
3. Change the `status-overall` line from `[ ]` to `[x]`

**Purpose of DECOMPOSITION artifact**: Break down the overall DESIGN into implementable work packages (features) that can be assigned, tracked, and implemented independently.

**What this checklist tests**: Quality of the decomposition itself — not the quality of requirements, design decisions, security, performance, or other concerns. Those belong in PRD and DESIGN checklists.

**Key principle**: A perfect decomposition has:
1. **100% coverage** — every design element appears in at least one feature
2. **No overlap** — no design element appears in multiple features without clear reason
3. **Complete attributes** — every feature has identification, purpose, scope, dependencies
4. **Consistent granularity** — features are at similar abstraction levels
5. **Bidirectional traceability** — can trace both ways between design and features

# DECOMPOSITION Expert Checklist

**Artifact**: Design Decomposition (DECOMPOSITION)
**Version**: 2.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03
**Purpose**: Validate quality of design decomposition into implementable work packages

---

## Referenced Standards

This checklist validates decomposition quality based on the following international standards:

| Standard | Domain | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [IEEE 1016-2009](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1016/4502/) | **Design Decomposition** | Software Design Descriptions — Decomposition Description viewpoint (§5.4) |
| [ISO 21511:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/69702.html) | **Work Breakdown Structure** | WBS for project/programme management — scope decomposition, 100% rule |
| [ISO 10007:2017](https://www.iso.org/standard/70400.html) | **Configuration Management** | Configuration items, product structure, baselines |
| [ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html) | **Architecture Description** | Architecture viewpoints, model correspondences, consistency |
| [ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/72089.html) | **Requirements Traceability** | Bidirectional traceability, verification |
---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates DECOMPOSITION artifacts (design breakdown into features)
- [ ] I have access to the source DESIGN artifact being decomposed
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will use the [Reporting](#reporting) format for output

---

## Applicability Context

**Purpose of DECOMPOSITION artifact**: Break down the overall DESIGN into implementable work packages (features) that can be assigned, tracked, and implemented independently.

**What this checklist tests**: Quality of the decomposition itself — not the quality of requirements, design decisions, security, performance, or other concerns. Those belong in PRD and DESIGN checklists.

**Key principle**: A perfect decomposition has:
1. **100% coverage** — every design element appears in at least one feature
2. **No overlap** — no design element appears in multiple features without clear reason
3. **Complete attributes** — every feature has identification, purpose, scope, dependencies
4. **Consistent granularity** — features are at similar abstraction levels
5. **Bidirectional traceability** — can trace both ways between design and features

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Decomposition is fundamentally broken; cannot proceed to implementation.
- **HIGH**: Significant decomposition gap; should be fixed before implementation starts.
- **MEDIUM**: Decomposition improvement needed; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

---

## Checkpointing (Long Reviews)

### Checkpoint After Each Domain

After completing each expertise domain (COV, EXC, ATTR, etc.), output:
```
✓ {DOMAIN} complete: {N} items checked, {M} issues found
Issues: {list issue IDs}
Remaining: {list unchecked domains}
```

### Minimum Viable Review

If full review impossible, prioritize in this order:
1. **COV-001** (CRITICAL) — WBS 100% Rule
2. **EXC-001** (CRITICAL) — Mutual Exclusivity
3. **ATTR-001** (HIGH) — Entity Identification
4. **TRC-001** (HIGH) — Forward Traceability
5. **DOC-001** (CRITICAL) — Deliberate Omissions

Mark review as "PARTIAL" if not all domains completed.

`@cpt:example:decomposition-overview`
```markdown
TaskFlow design is decomposed into features organized around core task management capabilities. The decomposition follows a dependency order where foundational CRUD operations enable higher-level features like notifications and reporting.

**Decomposition Strategy**:
- Features grouped by functional cohesion (related capabilities together)
- Dependencies minimize coupling between features
- Each feature covers specific components and sequences from DESIGN
- 100% coverage of all DESIGN elements verified
