### CODE Commands
- `cypilot validate --artifact <code-path>` — validate code traceability and quality
- `cypilot where-defined --id <id>` — find where an ID is defined in artifacts
- `cypilot where-used --id <id>` — find where an ID is referenced in code via `@cpt-*` markers
### CODE Workflows
- **Generate CODE**: implement FEATURE design with optional `@cpt-*` traceability markers
- **Analyze CODE**: validate implementation coverage, traceability, tests, and quality

**Source** (one of, in priority order):

2. Other Cypilot artifact — PRD, DESIGN, ADR, DECOMPOSITION
3. Similar content — user-provided description, feature, or requirements
4. Prompt only — direct user instructions

**ALWAYS read** the FEATURE artifact being implemented (the source of `to_code="true"` IDs). The FEATURE contains flows, algorithms, states, and definition-of-done tasks that define what code must do.

**ALWAYS read** the system's DESIGN artifact (if registered in `artifacts.toml`) to understand overall architecture, components, principles, and constraints before implementing code.

CODE implementation triggers upstream checkbox updates through markers:

| Code Marker | FEATURE ID | Upstream Effect |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| `@cpt-flow:{cpt-id}:p{N}` | kind: `flow` | When all pN markers exist → check `flow` ID in FEATURE |
| `@cpt-algo:{cpt-id}:p{N}` | kind: `algo` | When all pN markers exist → check `algo` ID in FEATURE |
| `@cpt-state:{cpt-id}:p{N}` | kind: `state` | When all pN markers exist → check `state` ID in FEATURE |
| `@cpt-dod:{cpt-id}:p{N}` | kind: `dod` | When all pN markers exist + evidence complete → check `dod` ID in FEATURE |

**Full Cascade Chain**:
```
CODE markers exist
    ↓
FEATURE: flow/algo/state/dod IDs → [x]
    ↓
DECOMPOSITION: feature entry [x]
    ↓
PRD/DESIGN: referenced IDs [x] when ALL downstream refs [x]
```

**When to Update Upstream Checkboxes**:
1. **After implementing CDSL instruction**: add block markers, mark step `[x]` in FEATURE
2. **After completing flow/algo/state/dod**: all steps `[x]` → mark ID `[x]` in FEATURE
3. **After completing FEATURE**: all IDs `[x]` → mark feature entry `[x]` in DECOMPOSITION
4. **After DECOMPOSITION updated**: check if all referenced IDs are `[x]` → mark in PRD/DESIGN

**Consistency rules (MANDATORY)**:
- [ ] Never mark CDSL instruction `[x]` unless corresponding code block markers exist and wrap non-empty implementation code
- [ ] Never add code block marker pair unless corresponding CDSL instruction exists in design (add it first if missing)
- [ ] Parent ID checkbox state MUST be consistent with all nested task-tracked items within its scope (as determined by heading boundaries)
- [ ] Task-tracked items include:
  - ID definitions with a task checkbox (e.g. `- [ ] p1 - **ID**: cpt-...`)
  - Task-checkbox references inside content (e.g. `- [ ] p1 - cpt-...`)
- [ ] If parent ID is `[x]` then ALL nested task-tracked items within its scope MUST be `[x]`
- [ ] If ALL nested task-tracked items within its scope are `[x]` then parent ID MUST be `[x]`
- [ ] Never mark a reference as `[x]` if its definition is still `[ ]` (cross-artifact consistency is validated)

**Validation Checks**:
- `cypilot validate` will warn if code marker exists but FEATURE checkbox is `[ ]`
- `cypilot validate` will warn if FEATURE checkbox is `[x]` but code marker is missing
- `cypilot validate` will report coverage: N% of FEATURE IDs have code markers

  - Interface Segregation: Prefer small, purpose-driven interfaces over broad ones
  - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions; inject dependencies for testability
- [ ] **DRY**: Remove duplication by extracting shared logic with clear ownership
- [ ] **KISS**: Prefer simplest correct solution matching design and project conventions
- [ ] **YAGNI**: No specs/abstractions not required by current design scope
- [ ] **Refactoring discipline**: Refactor only after tests pass; keep behavior unchanged
- [ ] **Testability**: Structure code so core logic is testable without heavy integration
- [ ] **Error handling**: Fail explicitly with clear errors; never silently ignore failures

```
````markdown
**Traceability Mode ON only.**

Apply markers per feature:
- **Scope markers**: `@cpt-{kind}:{cpt-id}:p{N}` — single-line, at function/class entry point
- **Block markers**: `@cpt-begin:{cpt-id}:p{N}:inst-{local}` / `@cpt-end:...` — paired, wrapping **only the specific lines** that implement one CDSL instruction

**Granularity rules (MANDATORY)**:
1. Each `@cpt-begin`/`@cpt-end` pair wraps the **smallest code fragment** that implements its CDSL instruction
2. When a function implements multiple CDSL instructions, place **separate** begin/end pairs for each instruction inside the function body
3. Place markers as **close to the implementing code as possible** — directly above/below the relevant lines
4. Do NOT wrap an entire function body with a single begin/end pair when the function implements multiple instructions

**Correct** — each instruction wrapped individually:
```python
# @cpt-algo:cpt-system-algo-process:p1
def process_data(items):
    # @cpt-begin:cpt-system-algo-process:p1:inst-validate
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("Empty input")
    # @cpt-end:cpt-system-algo-process:p1:inst-validate

    # @cpt-begin:cpt-system-algo-process:p1:inst-transform
    result = [transform(item) for item in items]
    # @cpt-end:cpt-system-algo-process:p1:inst-transform

    # @cpt-begin:cpt-system-algo-process:p1:inst-return-result
    return result
    # @cpt-end:cpt-system-algo-process:p1:inst-return-result
```

**WRONG** — entire function wrapped with one pair (loses per-instruction traceability):
```python
# @cpt-begin:cpt-system-algo-process:p1:inst-validate
def process_data(items):
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("Empty input")
    result = [transform(item) for item in items]
    return result
# @cpt-end:cpt-system-algo-process:p1:inst-validate

Run expert panel review after producing validation output.

**Review Scope Selection**:

| Change Size | Review Mode | Experts |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| <50 LOC, single concern | Abbreviated | Developer + 1 relevant expert |
| 50-200 LOC, multiple concerns | Standard | Developer, QA, Security, Architect |
| >200 LOC or architectural | Full | All 8 experts |

**Abbreviated Review** (for small, focused changes):
1. Developer reviews code quality and design alignment
2. Select ONE additional expert based on change type
3. Skip remaining experts with note: `Abbreviated review: {N} LOC, single concern`

**Full Expert Panel**: Developer, QA Engineer, Security Expert, Performance Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Architect, Monitoring Engineer, Database Architect/Data Engineer

**For EACH expert:**
1. Adopt role (write: `Role assumed: {expert}`)
2. Review actual code and tests in validation scope
3. If design artifact available: evaluate design-to-code alignment
4. Identify issues (contradictions, missing behavior, unclear intent, unnecessary complexity, missing non-functional concerns)
5. Provide concrete proposals (what to remove, add, rewrite)
6. Propose corrective workflow: `feature`, `design`, or `code`

**Expert review output format:**
```
**Review status**: COMPLETED
**Reviewed artifact**: Code ({scope})
- **Role assumed**: {expert}
- **Checklist completed**: YES
- **Findings**:
- **Proposed edits**:
**Recommended corrective workflow**: {feature | design | code}
```

**PASS only if:**
- Build/lint/tests pass per project config
- Coverage meets project requirements
- No CRITICAL divergences between code and design
- If Traceability Mode ON: required tags present and properly paired

# Cypilot SDLC Code Checklist (Kit-Specific)

ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/requirements/code-checklist.md` FIRST

**Artifact**: Code Implementation (Cypilot SDLC)
**Version**: 1.0
**Purpose**: Kit-specific checks that require Cypilot SDLC artifacts (PRD/DESIGN/DECOMPOSITION/FEATURE/ADR) and/or Cypilot traceability.

## Traceability Preconditions

Before running the SDLC-specific checks:

- [ ] Determine traceability mode from `artifacts.toml` for the relevant system/artifact: `FULL` vs `DOCS-ONLY`
- [ ] If `FULL`: identify the design source(s) to trace (Feature design is preferred)
- [ ] If `DOCS-ONLY`: skip traceability requirements and validate semantics against provided design sources

- [ ] Resolve Feature design via `@cpt-*` markers using the `cypilot where-defined` or `cypilot where-used` skill
- [ ] If no `@cpt-*` markers exist, ask the user to provide the Feature design location before proceeding
- [ ] If the user is unsure, search the repository for candidate feature designs and present options for user selection
- [ ] Resolve Overall Design by following references from the Feature design (or ask the user for the design path)
