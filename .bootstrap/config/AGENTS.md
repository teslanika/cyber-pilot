### Project Rules

ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/rules/tech-stack.md` WHEN writing code, choosing technologies, or adding dependencies

ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/rules/conventions.md` WHEN writing code, naming files/functions/variables, or reviewing code

ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/rules/project-structure.md` WHEN creating files, adding modules, or navigating codebase

ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/rules/domain-model.md` WHEN working with entities, data structures, or business logic

ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/rules/testing.md` WHEN writing tests, reviewing test coverage, or debugging

ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/rules/build-deploy.md` WHEN building, deploying, or configuring CI/CD

## Development Rules

NEVER edit files inside `{cypilot_path}/.core/` or `{cypilot_path}/.gen/` directly — they are read-only copies. ALWAYS edit the canonical source files under project root (`skills/`, `kits/`, `schemas/`, etc.) and then run `cpt update --source . --force` to sync changes into `{cypilot_path}/`.
