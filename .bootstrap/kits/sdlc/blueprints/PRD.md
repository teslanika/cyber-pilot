# PRD Blueprint
Blueprint for Product Requirements Documents (PRD).

This file is the single source of truth for:
- template.md generation (from @cpt:heading + @cpt:prompt markers)
- example.md generation (from @cpt:heading examples + @cpt:example markers)
- rules.md generation (from @cpt:rules + @cpt:rule markers)
- checklist.md generation (from @cpt:checklist + @cpt:check markers)
- constraints.toml contributions (from @cpt:heading + @cpt:id markers)

All text between markers is ignored by the generator — it serves as
human-readable documentation for anyone editing this blueprint.

Based on: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018, ISO/IEC 25010:2011

## Metadata

> **`@cpt:blueprint`** — Blueprint metadata: artifact kind, kit slug, version. Internal; not output to any file.

`@cpt:blueprint`
```toml
# Artifact kind: PRD | ADR | DESIGN | DECOMPOSITION | FEATURE | CODE
artifact = "PRD"
codebase = false
```
`@/cpt:blueprint`

## Skill Integration

Commands and workflows exposed to AI agents for PRD operations.

> **`@cpt:skill`** — Skill content. Agent-facing navigation and instructions. Output: `.gen/kits/{slug}/SKILL.md`.

`@cpt:skill`
```markdown
### PRD Commands
- `cypilot validate --artifact <PRD.md>` — validate PRD structure and IDs
- `cypilot list-ids --kind fr` — list all functional requirements
- `cypilot list-ids --kind actor` — list all actors
- `cypilot where-defined --id <id>` — find where a PRD ID is defined
- `cypilot where-used --id <id>` — find where a PRD ID is referenced downstream
### PRD Workflows
- **Generate PRD**: create a new PRD from template with guided prompts per section
- **Analyze PRD**: validate structure (deterministic) then semantic quality (checklist-based)
```
`@/cpt:skill`

## Rules Definition

Rules are organized into sections that map to the generated `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/PRD/rules.md`.

### Rules Skeleton

> **`@cpt:rules`** — Rules skeleton. Defines section structure (prerequisites, requirements, tasks, validation, etc.) for `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/PRD/rules.md`.

`@cpt:rules`
```toml

[requirements]
# Ordered list of section keys (each needs a matching @cpt:rule block)
sections = ["structural", "versioning", "semantic", "traceability", "constraints", "deliberate_omissions"]
# Display names for non-obvious requirement section keys
[requirements.names]
deliberate_omissions = "Deliberate Omissions (MUST NOT HAVE)"

# Task phases — step-by-step workflow for creating the artifact
[tasks]
# Ordered list of phase keys (each needs a matching @cpt:rule block)
phases = ["setup", "content_creation", "ids_and_structure", "quality_check"]

- [ ] Treat `constraints.toml` as primary validator for:
  - where IDs are defined
  - where IDs are referenced
  - which cross-artifact references are required / optional / prohibited

**References**:
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/requirements/kit-constraints.md`
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/schemas/kit-constraints.schema.json`

**Validation Checks**:
- `cypilot validate` enforces `identifiers[<kind>].references` rules (required / optional / prohibited)
- `cypilot validate` enforces headings scoping for ID definitions and references
- `cypilot validate` enforces "checked ref implies checked def" consistency

```
```markdown
Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the product's domain** — What kind of product is this PRD for? (e.g., consumer app, enterprise platform, developer tool, internal system)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all PRDs:
   - An internal tool PRD may not need market positioning analysis
   - A developer framework PRD may not need end-user personas
   - A methodology PRD may not need regulatory compliance analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

For each major checklist category (BIZ, ARCH, SEC, TEST, MAINT), confirm:

- [ ] Category is addressed in the document, OR
- [ ] Category is explicitly marked "Not applicable" with reasoning, OR
- [ ] Category absence is reported as a violation (with applicability justification)
```

When reviewing PRs that add or change PRD/requirements documents, additionally focus on:

- [ ] Completeness and clarity of requirements
- [ ] Testability and acceptance criteria for every requirement
- [ ] Traceability to business goals and stated problems
- [ ] Compliance with `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/PRD/template.md` structure (generated from blueprint)
- [ ] Alignment with best industry standard practices for large SaaS systems and platforms
- [ ] Critical assessment of requirements quality — challenge vague, overlapping, or untestable items
- [ ] Split findings by checklist category and rate each 1-10
- [ ] Ensure requirements are aligned with the project's existing architecture (see DESIGN artifacts)

## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates PRD artifacts
- [ ] I will follow the Applicability Context rules below
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] I will complete the Final Checklist and provide a review report
- [ ] I will use the [Reporting](#reporting) format for output (see end of document)

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the product's domain** — What kind of product is this PRD for? (e.g., consumer app, enterprise platform, developer tool, internal system)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all PRDs:
   - An internal tool PRD may not need market positioning analysis
   - A developer framework PRD may not need end-user personas
   - A methodology PRD may not need regulatory compliance analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it's not mentioned. Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Unsafe/misleading/unverifiable; blocks downstream work.
- **HIGH**: Major ambiguity/risk; should be fixed before approval.
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

---

## Applicability Determination

**For items marked "(if applicable)"**, determine applicability using these criteria:

| Domain | Applicable When | Not Applicable When |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Market positioning (BIZ-PRD-002) | External product, competitive market | Internal tool, no competitors |
| SSO/federation (SEC-PRD-001) | Enterprise product, multi-tenant | Single-user tool, local-only |
| Privacy by Design (SEC-PRD-005) | Handles EU personal data, PII | No personal data processing |
| Safety (SAFE-PRD-001/002) | Could harm people/property/environment, medical devices, vehicles, industrial | Pure information system, no physical interaction |
| Regulatory (COMPL-PRD-001) | Handles PII, financial data, healthcare | Internal dev tool, no user data |
| Accessibility (UX-PRD-002) | Public-facing, government, enterprise | Internal tool with known user base |
| Inclusivity (UX-PRD-005) | Diverse user base, public-facing | Narrow technical audience, internal tool |
| Internationalization (UX-PRD-003) | Multi-region deployment planned | Single-locale deployment |
| Offline capability (UX-PRD-004) | Mobile app, unreliable network | Server-side tool, always-connected |

**When uncertain**: Mark as applicable and let the PRD author explicitly exclude with reasoning.

---

## Checkpointing (Long Reviews)

This checklist is 700+ lines. For reviews that may exceed context limits:

### Checkpoint After Each Domain

After completing each expertise domain (BIZ, ARCH, SEC, etc.), output:
```
✓ {DOMAIN} complete: {N} items checked, {M} issues found
Issues: {list issue IDs}
Remaining: {list unchecked domains}
```

### If Context Runs Low

1. **Save progress**: List completed domains and issues found so far
2. **Note position**: "Stopped at {DOMAIN}-{ID}"
3. **Resume instruction**: "Continue from {DOMAIN}-{ID}, issues so far: {list}"

### Minimum Viable Review

If full review impossible, prioritize in this order:
1. **BIZ** (CRITICAL) — Vision, Requirements, Use Cases
2. **ARCH-PRD-001** (CRITICAL) — Scope Boundaries
3. **SEC-PRD-001/002** (CRITICAL) — Auth/Authorization
4. **DOC-PRD-001** (CRITICAL) — Deliberate Omissions
5. **MUST NOT HAVE** (all CRITICAL/HIGH items)

Mark review as "PARTIAL" if not all domains completed.

## Template Structure

Headings, prompts, IDs, and examples that define the generated `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/PRD/template.md`
and `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/sdlc/artifacts/PRD/examples/example.md` files. The PRD template covers: overview, actors, operational
context, scope, functional/non-functional requirements, interfaces, use cases,
acceptance criteria, dependencies, assumptions, and risks.
