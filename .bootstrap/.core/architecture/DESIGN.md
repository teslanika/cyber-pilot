## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

Cypilot uses a layered architecture with a thin global CLI proxy at the top, a deterministic skill engine at the core, and a kit system for domain-specific functionality. The architecture maximizes determinism: all validation, scanning, and transformation is handled by Python scripts with JSON output; LLMs are reserved only for reasoning tasks within agent workflows.

The system separates concerns into five layers: Global CLI Proxy (installation, caching, version management), Core Skill Engine (command routing, deterministic execution), Kit System (domain-specific blueprints, generated templates, rules, validation), Config Management (structured config directory, schema validation), and Agent Integration (multi-agent entry point generation). Each layer has clear boundaries and communicates through well-defined interfaces.

Each kit is a blueprint package: a `blueprints/` directory containing one `.md` file per artifact kind. During installation, blueprints are copied into `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/blueprints/` (user-editable) and all resources (templates, checklists, rules, constraints, examples, workflows) are generated from them. The core knows about kits through registration in `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml`. A plugin system for custom markers and CLI subcommands is planned for p2.

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

##### Global CLI Installer

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-installer`

**Design Response**: Thin proxy shell with local cache at `~/.cypilot/cache/`. On every invocation the proxy ensures a cached skill bundle exists, routes commands to the project-installed or cached skill, and performs non-blocking background version checks. The proxy contains zero skill logic.

##### Project Initialization

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-init`

**Design Response**: Interactive bootstrapper that copies the skill from cache into the project, creates the `config/` directory structure, and generates agent entry points. Installed kits populate their own config directories with baseline autodetect rules.

##### Config Directory

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-config`

**Design Response**: `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` holds system definitions, kit registrations, and ignore lists. `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/` directories hold per-kit blueprints, generated artifacts, and workflows. All config files use TOML format with deterministic serialization. Cypilot core manages `core.toml` and the Blueprint Processor manages generated outputs.

##### Deterministic Skill Engine

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-skill-engine`

**Design Response**: Python command router that dispatches to command handlers. All commands output JSON. Exit codes follow the convention: 0=PASS, 1=filesystem error, 2=FAIL. SKILL.md serves as the agent entry point with command reference and execution protocol.

##### Generic Workflows

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workflows`

**Design Response**: Two universal Markdown workflows (generate and analyze) with a common execution protocol. Workflows are loaded and interpreted by AI agents, not by the tool itself. The tool provides deterministic commands that workflows invoke.

##### Multi-Agent Integration

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-agents`

**Design Response**: Agent Generator component produces entry points in each agent's native format: `.windsurf/workflows/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.github/prompts/`. All entry points reference the core SKILL.md. The `agents` command fully overwrites entry points on each invocation.

##### Extensible Kit System

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-kits`

**Design Response**: Kit Manager handles kit lifecycle: installation (saving kit source to `{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/`, copying blueprints to `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}/blueprints/`), registration in `core.toml`, resource generation, version tracking, and migration. Each kit is a `blueprints/` directory with one `.md` per artifact kind. A plugin system for custom CLI subcommands and hooks is planned for p2.

##### ID and Traceability System

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-traceability`

**Design Response**: Traceability Engine scans artifacts for `cpt-{system}-{kind}-{slug}` IDs, resolves cross-references, detects code tags (`@cpt-*`), and provides query commands (list-ids, where-defined, where-used, get-content). Validation enforces constraints from `constraints.toml`.

##### Cypilot DSL (CDSL)

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-cdsl`

**Design Response**: CDSL is a plain English specification language embedded in Markdown. The tool parses CDSL instruction markers (`- [ ] Inst-label:`) for implementation tracking. CDSL validation is part of the Validator component's template compliance checks.

##### SDLC Kit

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-plugin`

**Design Response**: The SDLC kit is a blueprint package providing artifact definitions for PRD, DESIGN, ADR, DECOMPOSITION, and FEATURE. The Blueprint Processor deterministically generates all kit resources (templates, examples, rules, checklists, constraints, workflows) from the blueprints in `kits/sdlc/blueprints/`. Kit-specific CLI subcommands for managing autodetect rules and artifact patterns are planned for p2.

##### Artifact Validation

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-validation`

**Design Response**: Validator component performs single-pass scanning of artifact files: template structure compliance, ID format validation, priority marker presence, placeholder detection, and constraint enforcement. Cross-artifact validation checks covered_by references, checked consistency, and ID resolution across all registered artifacts.

##### PR Review Workflow

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-pr-review`

**Design Response**: PR review uses `gh` CLI to fetch PR data (diffs, metadata, comments), then delegates analysis to the AI agent with configurable prompts and checklists. The workflow is read-only (no local working tree modifications) and always re-fetches data on each invocation.

##### Version Detection and Updates

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-version`

**Design Response**: The `update` command copies the cached skill into the project, migrates `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml`, invokes each kit's migration script, and regenerates agent entry points. Config migration preserves all user settings. Version information is accessible via `--version`.

##### CLI Configuration Interface

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-cli-config`

**Design Response**: Core CLI commands manage `core.toml` (system definitions, ignore lists, kit registrations). All config changes are validated against schemas before application. Dry-run mode is supported. Kit-specific CLI subcommands are planned for p2.

##### VS Code Plugin

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-vscode-plugin`

**Design Response**: VS Code extension delegates all validation to the installed Cypilot skill (`cpt validate`). The plugin reads config from the project's install directory, provides ID syntax highlighting, go-to-definition, real-time validation, autocompletion, hover info, CodeLens, traceability tree view, and quick fixes.

##### Artifact Pipeline

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-pipeline`

**Design Response**: The SDLC kit defines an artifact-first pipeline: PRD → DESIGN → ADR → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE. Each artifact kind has a single Artifact Blueprint from which all resources (template, checklist, rules, constraints) are generated. Artifacts are usable independently (no forced sequence). The generate and analyze workflows handle both greenfield and brownfield entry points.

##### Artifact Blueprint

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-blueprint`

**Design Response**: The Blueprint Processor is a core component that defines the blueprint contract and executes generation. Each artifact kind has one blueprint file (`<KIND>.md` in `blueprints/`) — a Markdown file that IS the template enriched with backtick-delimited `@cpt:` markers. Markers support two syntax forms: **named** (`` `@cpt:type:id` `` / `` `@/cpt:type:id` ``) where `id` is a kebab-case slug providing stable identity for merge, and **legacy** (`` `@cpt:type` `` / `` `@/cpt:type` ``) for backward compatibility. Named syntax is required for new blueprints; legacy syntax triggers a deprecation warning. The content between markers consists of fenced code blocks (` ```toml ` for config, ` ```markdown ` for content). `@cpt:blueprint` is the identity marker (first in file); `@cpt:heading` markers define the template structure; metadata markers (`@cpt:rule`, `@cpt:check`, `@cpt:skill`, `@cpt:system-prompt`, `@cpt:workflow`, `@cpt:id`) are stripped when generating `template.md`; `@cpt:prompt` content is kept — it appears under headings as writing instructions. All markers are flat (no nesting); free text outside markers is ignored and can serve as documentation. The core defines the format, the reference-based update model, and built-in marker types: `@cpt:blueprint` (identity + metadata), `@cpt:skill` (SKILL.md extensions), `@cpt:system-prompt` (agent context extensions), `@cpt:workflow` (workflow command registrations → AGENTS.md).

**Marker identity**: Each marker has a **stable identity key** used by the three-way merge to match markers across versions. Resolution chain: (1) explicit syntax ID from `` `@cpt:TYPE:ID` `` → key = `TYPE:ID`; (2) TOML-derived key for structured markers (`heading:{id}`, `id:{kind}`, `workflow:{name}`); (3) positional index fallback for legacy unnamed markers (`TYPE#N`). Singleton markers (`blueprint`, `skill`, `system-prompt`, `rules`, `checklist`) use their type as the key.

Blueprints use **placeholder syntax** `{descriptive text}` in `@cpt:heading` TOML `template` keys — the text inside `{...}` serves as the writing prompt. From each heading the processor derives: `template.md` gets the heading text with placeholders, `constraints.toml` gets the `pattern` regex (if specified) for validation, and `example.md` gets the first value from the `examples` array. Body-level examples are provided via `@cpt:example` blocks.

All outputs are **core-defined** — the Blueprint Processor owns all marker types and output generators. Per-artifact outputs: `rules.md` (from `@cpt:rules` + `@cpt:rule`), `checklist.md` (from `@cpt:checklist` + `@cpt:check`), `template.md` (headings from `@cpt:heading` + writing instructions from `@cpt:prompt`), `example.md` (from `@cpt:heading` examples + `@cpt:example`). Kit-wide output: `constraints.toml` (aggregated from `@cpt:heading` + `@cpt:id` across all artifact blueprints, placed at `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/<slug>/constraints.toml`). Codebase outputs: `codebase/rules.md` and `codebase/checklist.md` (from blueprints without `artifact` key). Custom marker types and output generators are planned for p2.

**Update model**: The **installed kit** in `{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/` serves as the reference for all update operations. Two modes: **force** (`cypilot kit update --force`) updates the reference, overwrites all user blueprints, and regenerates all outputs; **additive** (`cypilot kit update`, default) computes a three-way merge using the old reference (`{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/.prev/`) vs. the user's blueprint (`{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}/blueprints/`) vs. the new reference. Markers are matched across all three versions by their **stable identity key** (see Marker identity above). Merge rules: markers unchanged by the user are updated to the new version; user-modified markers are preserved (skipped); truly new markers (in new reference but not in old) are inserted at anchor-relative positions — nearest preceding known marker as anchor, forward search when anchor deleted, append as last resort; markers deleted by the user stay deleted (not re-inserted even if present in new reference). As a final merge step, **legacy marker upgrade** rewrites any remaining unnamed markers (`@cpt:TYPE`) to named syntax (`@cpt:TYPE:ID`) using the derived identity key — `heading:{id}`, `id:{kind}`, `workflow:{name}`, `check:{id}` (lowercased), `rule:{kind}-{section}` (with `-{N}` suffix for duplicates), `prompt`/`example` keyed to nearest heading ID. Singleton markers are skipped. This ensures migrated blueprints gain stable explicit IDs. After a successful merge, the reference is replaced with the new version.

**SKILL extensions**: blueprints may contain `@cpt:skill` blocks that are aggregated across all blueprints and written to `{cypilot_path}/config/SKILL.md` during init/kit-install. The main SKILL.md has a navigation rule to `{cypilot_path}/config/SKILL.md`, ensuring AI agents discover kit capabilities automatically.

**System prompt extensions**: blueprints may contain `@cpt:system-prompt` blocks that are aggregated and appended to `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md` during init/kit-install. Since `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md` is loaded via the Protocol Guard, these directives are automatically active for the corresponding artifact kinds.

**Workflow registrations**: blueprints may contain `@cpt:workflow` blocks (TOML header with `name` and `description`, plus Markdown content with workflow steps). The Blueprint Processor generates a workflow `.md` file in `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/<slug>/workflows/{name}.md`. During `cpt generate-agents`, the Agent Generator creates entry points in each agent's native format (e.g., `.windsurf/workflows/cypilot-{name}.md`) that reference the kit workflow file. This allows kits to register workflows discoverable by all supported agents without manual agent-specific configuration.

##### Cross-Artifact Validation

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-cross-artifact`

**Design Response**: The Validator component performs cross-artifact checks by loading all registered artifacts for a system and comparing ID definitions against references. Checks include: covered_by reference completeness per constraints.toml rules, checked-ref-implies-checked-def consistency, and ID resolution across artifact boundaries. Cross-artifact validation runs as part of `cpt validate` (no separate command).

##### PR Status Workflow

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-pr-status`

**Design Response**: PR status reuses the same `gh` CLI integration as PR review. The workflow fetches comments, CI status, and merge conflict state, then classifies unreplied comments by severity. Output is a structured JSON report. Shares the SDLC kit's PR configuration (prompts, exclude lists).

##### Code Generation from Design

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-code-gen`

**Design Response**: Code generation is an agent-driven workflow (not a deterministic command). The generate workflow loads FEATURE artifacts, reads project system prompts (domain model, API contracts) when present, and instructs the agent to produce code with `@cpt-*` traceability tags. The tool validates tags after generation via the Traceability Engine.

##### Brownfield Support

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-brownfield`

**Design Response**: Brownfield entry uses `cpt init` with existing code detection. The SDLC kit's autodetect rules scan for existing documentation and code structure. The generate workflow supports reverse-engineering mode: agents analyze existing code and produce artifacts (PRD, DESIGN) that describe the current state. Incremental adoption is supported — start with config, add artifacts gradually.

##### Feature Lifecycle Management

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-lifecycle`

**Design Response**: Feature status (NOT_STARTED → IN_DESIGN → DESIGNED → READY → IN_PROGRESS → DONE) is tracked via checkbox state on FEATURE artifact ID definitions. The Validator enforces status transition rules and dependency blocking. Status queries use the Traceability Engine's ID scanning.

##### PR Review Configuration

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-pr-config`

**Design Response**: PR review configuration is stored in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/sdlc/`. Configuration includes prompt selection, checklist mapping, domain-specific review criteria, template variables, and PR exclude lists. Config changes are validated against the schema before writing. Kit-specific CLI subcommands for PR config management are planned for p2.

##### Quickstart Guides

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-guides`

**Design Response**: Quickstart guides are SDLC kit resources generated alongside templates and examples. Guides use progressive disclosure: human-facing overview docs with copy-paste prompts, and AI-facing navigation rules embedded in SKILL.md and agent entry points.

##### Utility Commands

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-toc`
- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-template-qa`
- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-doctor`
- [ ] `p3` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-hooks`
- [ ] `p3` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-completions`

**Design Response**: Utility commands are implemented as standalone handlers in the Skill Engine with no architectural impact beyond the standard command routing pattern. `self-check` validates examples against templates. `doctor` checks environment health (Python version, git, gh, agents, config integrity). `hook install/uninstall` manages git pre-commit hooks for lightweight validation. `completions install` generates shell completion scripts for bash/zsh/fish.

##### Spec Coverage

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-traceability`

**Design Response**: The `spec-coverage` command reuses the Traceability Engine's code scanning infrastructure to measure two metrics: **coverage percentage** (ratio of lines within `@cpt-begin`/`@cpt-end` blocks to total effective lines) and **granularity score** (instruction density — ideally 1 block marker per 10 lines). Output mirrors `coverage.py` JSON format with per-file and summary statistics. Threshold enforcement via `--min-coverage` and `--min-granularity` flags enables CI gating. Implementation lives in `skills/.../utils/coverage.py` (scanner + metrics) and `skills/.../commands/spec_coverage.py` (CLI entry point).

#### NFR Allocation

| NFR ID | NFR Summary | Allocated To | Design Response | Verification Approach |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-validation-performance` | Single artifact validation ≤ 3s | `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` | Single-pass scanning, no external calls, in-memory processing, no LLM dependency | Benchmark test with largest project artifact |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-security-integrity` | No untrusted code execution, deterministic results, no secrets in config | `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager`, `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` | Validator reads files as text only — no eval/exec. Config Manager rejects files containing known secret patterns. All commands are pure functions of input state | Determinism test: same repo state → same validation output |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-reliability-recoverability` | Actionable failure guidance, no settings loss on migration | `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager`, `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` | Config migration creates backup before applying changes. All error messages include file path, line number, and remediation steps | Migration test: upgrade config across 3 versions, verify no settings lost |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-adoption-usability` | ≤ 5 decisions in init, ≤ 3 clarifying questions per workflow | `cpt-cypilot-component-cli-proxy`, `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` | Init uses sensible defaults (all agents, all kits). CLI provides `--help` with usage examples for every command | Count decisions in init flow; count agent questions per workflow |

### 1.3 Architecture Layers

The architecture is organized into five layers stacked top-to-bottom, where each layer depends only on the layer directly below it.

At the top sits the **AI Agent layer** — external coding assistants (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex) that read SKILL.md as their entry point and invoke Cypilot commands. Immediately below is the **Agent Entry Points layer**: generated files in agent-native directories (`.windsurf/`, `.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.github/`) that contain workflow proxies and skill shims translating agent-specific formats into Cypilot CLI calls.

The **Global CLI Proxy layer** (`cypilot` / `cpt`, installed via pipx) is a thin stateless shell. It resolves the target skill — either from the project's local install directory or from the global cache (`~/.cypilot/cache/`) — and forwards the invocation. The proxy contains zero skill logic.

Below the proxy is the **Core Skill Engine layer** — the heart of the system. It owns the command router, JSON output serialization, SKILL.md, workflows, and the execution protocol. Three core components live here: the **Validator** (deterministic structural and cross-artifact checks), the **Traceability Engine** (ID scanning, resolution, and coverage analysis), and the **Config Manager** (schema-validated JSON config read/write with migration support).

At the bottom is the **Kit layer**. The **Kit Manager** handles kit installation (copying blueprints into `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/`), registration, and migration. Each kit is a blueprint package — the **SDLC Kit** being the primary one, providing blueprints for PRD, DESIGN, ADR, DECOMPOSITION, and FEATURE from which all resources (templates, checklists, rules, examples, constraints, workflows) are generated. A plugin system for custom hooks and CLI subcommands is planned for p2.

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### Determinism First

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-determinism-first`

Everything that can be validated, checked, or enforced without an LLM MUST be handled by deterministic scripts. The LLM is reserved only for tasks requiring reasoning, creativity, or natural language understanding. This ensures reproducible results: same input → same output, regardless of which AI agent runs the command.

#### Kit-Centric

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-kit-centric`

All domain-specific value is delivered by kits. Kits bring blueprints from which templates, checklists, rules, examples, constraints, and workflows are generated. Core provides infrastructure (ID system, workflows, config, agent integration, Blueprint Processor); kits provide the content and semantics. This separation ensures that new domains can be supported by adding a new kit with its `blueprints/` directory.

#### Traceability by Design

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-traceability-by-design`

All design elements use structured `cpt-*` IDs following the format `cpt-{system}-{kind}-{slug}`. Code tags (`@cpt-*`) link implementation to design. Cross-references between artifacts are validated deterministically. The ID system is the backbone of Cypilot's value proposition — it enables automated verification that code implements what was designed.

#### Plugin Extensibility

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-plugin-extensibility`

Kits are blueprint packages that define artifact kinds via `blueprints/*.md` files. All resources are generated from blueprints by the Blueprint Processor. Core does not interpret kit-specific semantics — it only knows that a kit is registered and where its blueprints and generated outputs live. User customizations (edits to blueprints in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/blueprints/`) are preserved across kit updates through the reference-based three-way diff mechanism. A plugin system for custom markers and hooks is planned for p2.

#### Machine-Readable Output

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-machine-readable`

All CLI commands output JSON to stdout. Config files use TOML with deterministic serialization. Validation results include file paths and line numbers. This enables programmatic consumption by CI pipelines, IDE plugins, and agent workflows without parsing human-readable text.

#### Tool-Managed Config

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-tool-managed-config`

Config files are edited exclusively by the tool, never manually. All changes go through CLI commands that validate against schemas before writing. This prevents configuration drift, ensures schema compliance, and enables reliable migration between versions.

#### Skill-Documented

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-skill-documented`

All tool capabilities MUST be fully documented in the agent-facing SKILL.md. SKILL.md is the single entry point for AI agents — it enumerates all commands, workflows, and integration points so agents can discover and use the tool's full functionality without external documentation.

#### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-dry`

Every piece of knowledge — a template, a rule, a checklist criterion, a config schema — MUST have exactly one authoritative source. Kits generate resources from a single definition; agent entry points are generated from one template per agent; validation rules live in constraints.toml, not duplicated across code. If something needs to change, it changes in one place.

#### Occam's Razor

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-occams-razor`

The simplest solution that satisfies the requirements is the correct one. No abstraction layers, extension points, or generalization beyond what is needed today. Prefer flat structures over nested, single-pass algorithms over multi-phase, plain functions over class hierarchies. Complexity must be justified by a concrete requirement, not by speculative future needs.

#### CI & Automation First, LLM Last Resort

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-ci-automation-first`

Every check, validation, and enforcement MUST be implementable as a deterministic CI step. LLM-based analysis is used only when deterministic methods are provably insufficient (e.g., semantic quality review, natural language understanding). If a task can be expressed as a regex, a schema check, or a graph traversal — it MUST NOT require an LLM. This ensures that quality gates are reproducible, fast, and free of hallucination risk.

#### Zero Harm, Only Benefits

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-zero-harm`

Adopting Cypilot MUST NOT impose costs on the development workflow. No mandatory file renames, no forced directory structures outside the Cypilot install directory and `config/`, no blocking CI gates by default, no slowdowns to existing processes. Every feature is opt-in and additive. If a team removes Cypilot, their project continues to work exactly as before — only the `{cypilot_path}/` directory and generated agent files are left behind.

#### No Manual Maintenance

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-no-manual-maintenance`

Nothing that can be generated MUST require manual upkeep. Agent entry points are regenerated on `update`. Kit resources are regenerated from blueprints. Config migrations run automatically. Shell completions are generated from command definitions. If a human must remember to update something after a version change, that is a bug in the tool.

### 2.2 Constraints

#### Python Standard Library Only

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-constraint-python-stdlib`

Core skill engine uses Python 3.11+ standard library only (requires `tomllib` from stdlib). No third-party dependencies in core. This ensures the tool works in any Python 3.11+ environment without dependency conflicts. Kits may declare their own dependencies, managed separately.

#### Markdown as Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-constraint-markdown-contract`

Artifacts are Markdown files with structured `cpt-*` IDs. Markdown is the contract format between humans, agents, and the tool. Workflows, templates, checklists, and rules are all Markdown. This leverages the universal readability of Markdown while enabling deterministic parsing of structured elements.

#### Git Project Heuristics

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-constraint-git-project-heuristics`

Git is the primary project detection mechanism (`.git` directory provides project root detection and version control integration). Non-Git projects are supported but without Git-based heuristics — the tool falls back to the current working directory as project root.

#### Cross-Platform Native Support

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-constraint-cross-platform`

CLI proxy and skill engine must work natively on Linux, Windows, and macOS without platform-specific workarounds or conditional dependencies. File paths use `pathlib`, subprocess calls avoid shell-specific syntax, and no OS-specific system calls are used. This constraint applies to all core components and kits.

#### No Weakening of Rules

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-constraint-no-weakening`

Validation rules cannot be bypassed or weakened in STRICT mode. The deterministic gate must pass before semantic review proceeds. This constraint ensures that the quality floor is maintained — agents cannot skip validation steps or downgrade severity of issues.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

**Technology**: Python dataclasses, TOML

**Core Entities**:

| Entity | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| System | A named project or subsystem with slug, kit assignment, and autodetect rules | `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` → systems[] |
| Artifact | A Markdown file of a specific kind (PRD, DESIGN, ADR, etc.) belonging to a system | Filesystem, registered via autodetect |
| Kit | A blueprint package with `blueprints/*.md` source files; installed into `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/` with generated outputs | `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` → kits{}, `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/` |
| Identifier | A `cpt-*` ID with kind, slug, definition location (file + line), and references | Scanned from artifact Markdown |
| Config | Structured TOML in `config/` directory — core.toml + per-kit configs | Filesystem |
| AgentEntryPoint | Generated file in an agent's native format (workflow proxy, skill shim, or rule file) | Generated into `.windsurf/`, `.cursor/`, etc. |
| Blueprint | Single-source-of-truth Markdown file per artifact kind with embedded `@cpt:` metadata markers; generates all kit resources | Source: `kits/<slug>/blueprints/<KIND>.md`, Installed: `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/blueprints/<KIND>.md` |
| Constraint | Kit-wide rules for ID kinds, headings, and cross-artifact references | Generated from `@cpt:heading`/`@cpt:id` markers across all artifact blueprints → `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/<slug>/constraints.toml` |
| Workflow | A Markdown file with frontmatter, phases, and validation criteria | `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/` |

**Relationships**:
- System → Kit: each system is assigned to exactly one kit (by slug)
- System → Artifact[]: a system contains zero or more artifacts, discovered via autodetect rules
- System → Codebase[]: a system tracks zero or more codebase directories
- Kit → Config: each kit owns config files in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/`
- Kit → Blueprint[]: each kit has one blueprint per artifact kind it defines
- Blueprint → Resource[]: each blueprint generates rules.md (mandatory) + kit-specific outputs (template, checklist, constraints, etc.)
- Blueprint → Constraint: blueprint `cpt:heading`/`cpt:id` markers generate constraint definitions
- Blueprint → SKILL extension: blueprint `cpt:skill` sections compose into the main SKILL.md
- Artifact → Identifier[]: each artifact contains zero or more ID definitions and references
- Identifier → Identifier: cross-references between definitions and references across artifacts
- Constraint → Identifier: constraints define which ID kinds are allowed/required per artifact kind

#### CLI Proxy

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-cli-proxy`

##### Why this component exists

Provides a stable global entry point (`cypilot`/`cpt`) that works both inside and outside projects. Manages the skill bundle cache so users don't need to manually download or update the tool.

##### Responsibility scope

- Maintain local skill bundle cache (`~/.cypilot/cache/`)
- Route commands to project-installed skill (if inside a project) or cached skill (if outside)
- Perform non-blocking background version checks
- Display version update notices when cached version is newer than project version

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT contain any skill logic, workflow logic, or command implementations. Does NOT interpret command arguments — passes them through to the resolved skill. Does NOT modify project files.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — proxies all commands to this component

#### Blueprint Processor

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-blueprint-processor`

##### Why this component exists

Eliminates resource duplication across kit artifacts. Without this component, every artifact kind requires separate manually-maintained files (template, rules, checklist, constraints) that duplicate structural knowledge and drift apart over time.

##### Responsibility scope

- Define the blueprint contract: Markdown file with backtick-delimited `@cpt:` markers supporting two syntax forms — named (`` `@cpt:TYPE:ID` ``) and legacy (`` `@cpt:TYPE` ``)
- Parse blueprints: scan for `` `@cpt:` `` prefix, extract markers by type, derive stable identity key per marker (explicit syntax ID → TOML-derived key → positional index fallback)
- Save kit source to `{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/` (reference); copy blueprints to `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}/blueprints/` (user-editable)
- Enforce mandatory output: generate `rules.md` from `@cpt:rules` + `@cpt:rule` markers for every blueprint
- Per-artifact generation: invoke output generators per marker type, write output files to `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/<slug>/artifacts/<KIND>/` deterministically
- Kit-wide constraints: aggregate `@cpt:heading` + `@cpt:id` markers from all artifact blueprints into `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/<slug>/constraints.toml`
- Codebase generation: for blueprints without `artifact` key, generate `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/<slug>/codebase/rules.md` and `codebase/checklist.md`
- Workflow generation: generate `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/<slug>/workflows/{name}.md` from `@cpt:workflow` markers
- Update model: force mode (update reference + full overwrite of user blueprints) and additive mode (identity-key-based three-way merge using `{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/.prev/` as old reference — match markers by stable identity key, update unmodified markers, preserve user-modified markers, insert new markers at anchor-relative positions, respect user deletions)
- SKILL composition: collect `@cpt:skill` sections from all loaded blueprints and write to `{cypilot_path}/config/SKILL.md`
- System prompt composition: collect `@cpt:system-prompt` sections from all loaded blueprints and append to `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md`
- Kit marker registry (p2): accept custom marker type registrations with corresponding output generators

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT validate generated outputs — delegates to Validator. Does NOT define kit-specific marker types in p1 — all SDLC markers are built-in; custom marker registration is planned for p2.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives `generate-resources` command
- `cpt-cypilot-component-sdlc-plugin` — provides blueprints with SDLC-specific markers (`@cpt:heading`, `@cpt:id`, `@cpt:check`)
- `cpt-cypilot-component-agent-generator` — consumes collected `cpt:skill` sections for SKILL.md composition
- `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager` — triggers blueprint processing during kit install/update

#### Skill Engine

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine`

##### Why this component exists

Central command dispatcher that provides a uniform interface for all Cypilot functionality. Ensures all commands follow the same conventions (JSON output, exit codes, deterministic behavior).

##### Responsibility scope

- Parse and route CLI commands to appropriate handlers
- Enforce JSON output format for all commands
- Manage exit code conventions (0=PASS, 1=error, 2=FAIL)
- Load and expose SKILL.md as the agent entry point
- Register kit commands at runtime (p2: kit plugin CLI subcommands)

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT execute workflows (workflows are interpreted by AI agents). Does NOT contain domain-specific validation logic (delegated to kits). Does NOT manage config schema — delegates to Config Manager.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-cli-proxy` — receives commands from proxy
- `cpt-cypilot-component-blueprint-processor` — delegates resource generation commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` — delegates validation commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-traceability-engine` — delegates ID query commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — delegates config commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager` — manages kit lifecycle
- `cpt-cypilot-component-agent-generator` — delegates agent commands

#### Validator

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-validator`

##### Why this component exists

Provides the deterministic quality gate that ensures artifacts meet structural requirements without relying on an LLM. This is the core of Cypilot's value — catching issues that agents miss or hallucinate.

##### Responsibility scope

- Template structure compliance checking (heading patterns, required sections)
- ID format validation (`cpt-{system}-{kind}-{slug}` pattern)
- Priority marker validation
- Placeholder detection (TODO, TBD, FIXME)
- Cross-reference validation (covered_by, checked consistency)
- Constraint enforcement from `constraints.toml` (headings scoping, reference rules)
- Blueprint validation: verify `cpt:blueprint` header present, all block markers closed, no nested blocks, all marker types registered, heading IDs unique
- TOC validation (`validate-toc`): verify anchors resolve, all headings covered, TOC not stale
- Stable error codes (`error_codes.py`): machine-readable codes for all validation issues, used by fixing prompts and downstream consumers
- Fixing prompt generation (`fixing.py`): enrich errors with actionable prompts for LLM agents
- Single-pass scanning for performance (≤ 3s per artifact)

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT perform semantic validation (checklist review is done by AI agents). Does NOT modify artifacts or blueprints — read-only analysis. Does NOT validate code files directly. Does NOT generate resources from blueprints — delegates to Blueprint Processor.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives validation commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-blueprint-processor` — delegates blueprint parsing for structural validation
- `cpt-cypilot-component-traceability-engine` — uses ID scanning results
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — reads config for system/artifact resolution
- `cpt-cypilot-component-sdlc-plugin` — p2: SDLC kit registers validation hooks

#### Traceability Engine

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-traceability-engine`

##### Why this component exists

Implements the ID system that links design elements to code. Without this component, there is no automated way to verify that code implements what was designed.

##### Responsibility scope

- Scan artifacts for ID definitions (`**ID**: \`cpt-...\``) and references (backticked `cpt-...`)
- Scan code for traceability tags (`@cpt-*`) with language-aware comment detection (`language_config.py`)
- Resolve cross-references between definitions and references
- Provide query commands: `list-ids`, `list-id-kinds`, `where-defined`, `where-used`, `get-content`
- Support ID versioning (`-vN` suffix)
- Markdown structure parsing (`parsing.py`): section extraction, heading analysis, content block identification
- Spec coverage analysis: measure CDSL marker coverage percentage and instruction granularity per code file

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT define which ID kinds are valid — that comes from kit constraints. Does NOT enforce cross-artifact reference rules — that's the Validator's job (using data from this engine). Does NOT modify files.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` — provides ID scan data for validation
- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives query commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — reads config for system/artifact resolution

#### Config Manager

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager`

##### Why this component exists

Ensures config integrity by centralizing all config file operations behind schema validation. Prevents configuration drift and enables reliable migration between versions.

##### Responsibility scope

- CRUD operations on `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` (system definitions, kit registrations, ignore lists)
- Schema validation before any write operation
- Deterministic TOML serialization
- Config migration between versions (with backup before migration)
- JSON → TOML format migration (`migrate-config` command): detect legacy `.json` files, convert to `.toml`, validate, remove originals
- Backward-compatible config loading: read `.toml` first, fall back to `.json` with deprecation warning
- Provide CLI commands for config inspection (`config show`)

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT manage kit blueprints or generated outputs — delegates to Blueprint Processor. Does NOT interpret kit-specific semantics.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives config commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager` — coordinates kit config creation during installation
- `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` — provides config data for validation context

#### Kit Manager

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager`

##### Why this component exists

Manages the kit lifecycle — installing, registering, updating, and migrating kits. Enables the extensible architecture where new domains can be added by providing a new kit with a `blueprints/` directory.

##### Responsibility scope

- Kit installation: save kit source to `{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/` (reference), copy blueprints to `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}/blueprints/` (user-editable), trigger Blueprint Processor to generate outputs
- Kit registration: add kit entry to `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml`
- Version tracking: store kit version in kit registration
- Update modes: force (`--force`) updates reference + overwrites all user blueprints and regenerates; additive (default) uses `{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/` as reference for three-way diff, preserving user modifications
- Kit structural validation (`validate-kits` command): verify `blueprints/` directory exists with valid blueprint files
- Plugin loading (p2): discover and load kit Python entry points at runtime

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT own kit resources (templates, checklists, rules) — delegates generation to Blueprint Processor. Does NOT interpret kit-specific marker semantics. Does NOT perform kit-specific validation.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives kit management commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — updates core.toml during kit registration
- `cpt-cypilot-component-blueprint-processor` — processes blueprints during install/update
- `cpt-cypilot-component-sdlc-plugin` — primary kit that is installed

#### Agent Generator

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-agent-generator`

##### Why this component exists

Bridges the gap between Cypilot's unified skill system and the diverse file format requirements of different AI coding assistants. Without this component, users would need to manually create and maintain agent-specific files.

##### Responsibility scope

- Generate workflow entry points in each agent's native format from `@cpt:workflow`-generated kit workflow files (e.g., `.windsurf/workflows/cypilot-{name}.md` → `kits/<kit>/workflows/{name}.md`)
- Compose SKILL.md: collect `@cpt:skill` extension sections from Blueprint Processor and assemble them into the main SKILL.md alongside core commands
- Generate skill shims that reference the composed SKILL.md
- Support 5 agents: Windsurf (`.windsurf/workflows/`), Cursor (`.cursor/rules/`), Claude (`.claude/commands/`), Copilot (`.github/prompts/`), OpenAI
- Full overwrite on each invocation (no merge with existing files)
- Support `--agent` flag for single-agent regeneration

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT maintain agent-specific state. Does NOT define SKILL extension content — collects from blueprints. Does NOT persist agent selection in config.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives `agents` command
- `cpt-cypilot-component-blueprint-processor` — provides `cpt:skill` sections for SKILL.md composition
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — reads config for project context

#### SDLC Kit

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-sdlc-plugin`

##### Why this component exists

Provides the artifact-first development methodology that is Cypilot's primary use case. Without this kit, Cypilot would be a generic ID system without domain-specific value.

##### Responsibility scope

- Blueprint authoring: provide blueprint `.md` files in `kits/sdlc/blueprints/` for each artifact kind (PRD, DESIGN, ADR, DECOMPOSITION, FEATURE) with SDLC-specific markers, placeholder syntax (`{name}`), `@cpt:example` blocks, `@cpt:skill` extensions, `@cpt:system-prompt` sections, and `@cpt:workflow` definitions
- Generated outputs (via Blueprint Processor): `@cpt:heading` + `@cpt:id` → `constraints.toml` (kit-wide); `@cpt:check` → `checklist.md`; `@cpt:rules` + `@cpt:rule` → `rules.md`; `@cpt:example` → `example.md`; `@cpt:heading` + `@cpt:prompt` → `template.md`; `@cpt:workflow` → `workflows/*.md`; codebase blueprints → `codebase/rules.md` + `codebase/checklist.md`
- PR review/status workflows: fetch PR data via `gh` CLI, analyze against configurable prompts

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT own the blueprint contract or processor — uses core Blueprint Processor. Does NOT own the ID system — uses core traceability engine. Does NOT manage `core.toml` — only its generated outputs in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/sdlc/`. Does NOT manage update logic — the core Blueprint Processor handles reference-based diffing and user modification preservation.

> Custom marker registration and CLI subcommands (`sdlc` namespace) are planned for p2.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-blueprint-processor` — processes SDLC blueprints and generates outputs
- `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager` — installs and manages kit lifecycle
- `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` — validates generated artifacts
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — reads core config for system/artifact context

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-interface-github-gh-cli`

**Direction**: required from client
**Protocol/Format**: GitHub REST/GraphQL API accessed through `gh` CLI v2.0+
**Used by**: SDLC Kit (PR review/status workflows)

### 3.4 Internal Dependencies

No internal module dependencies beyond the component relationships documented in Section 3.2. All components are part of a single Python package and communicate through direct function calls within the same process.

**Dependency Rules**:
- Components access each other through well-defined interfaces (not internal implementation details)
- Validator and Traceability Engine share scan results through a common data model (ID definitions, references)
- Kit plugins register hooks at startup — core components invoke hooks through a registry, not direct imports
- No circular dependencies: core components do not depend on kit plugins; plugins depend on core interfaces

### 3.5 External Dependencies

#### GitHub API (via `gh` CLI)

| Dependency | Interface Used | Purpose |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| `gh` CLI v2.0+ | CLI subprocess invocation | Fetch PR diffs, metadata, comments, and status for SDLC kit PR review/status workflows |

**Dependency Rules**:
- `gh` CLI is optional — only required for PR review/status workflows
- `cpt doctor` checks `gh` availability and authentication status
- PR workflows fail gracefully with actionable error message if `gh` is not available

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-init`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-init`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>CLI Proxy: cpt init
    CLI Proxy->>Skill Engine: init command
    Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: detect existing Cypilot install
    alt existing project detected
        Skill Engine-->>User: "Cypilot already initialized. Use 'cpt update' to upgrade."
    else new project
        Skill Engine->>User: "Install directory?" (default: cypilot)
        User-->>Skill Engine: confirms
        Skill Engine->>User: "Which agents?" (default: all)
        User-->>Skill Engine: selects agents
        Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: define root system (name/slug from directory)
        Skill Engine->>Config Manager: create config/ directory
        Config Manager->>Config Manager: write core.toml (root system, kit registrations)
        Config Manager->>Config Manager: write artifacts.toml (root system, autodetect defaults)
        Skill Engine->>Kit Manager: install all available kits
        Kit Manager->>SDLC Plugin: generate kit config + resources
        SDLC Plugin->>Config Manager: write config/kits/sdlc/
        Skill Engine->>Agent Generator: generate entry points
        Agent Generator->>Agent Generator: write .windsurf/, .cursor/, etc.
        Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: inject root AGENTS.md entry
        Config Manager->>Config Manager: write config/AGENTS.md (default WHEN rules)
        Skill Engine-->>User: "Cypilot initialized"
    end
```

**Description**: User initializes Cypilot in a project. The skill engine defines a **root system** (name and slug derived from the project directory name), creates full configs (`core.toml` with root system and kit registrations, `artifacts.toml` with default SDLC autodetect rules for standard artifact kinds), installs kits, generates agent entry points, and sets up `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md` with default WHEN rules.

**Root AGENTS.md injection**: During initialization (and verified on every CLI invocation), the engine ensures the project root `AGENTS.md` file contains a managed block that points agents to the Cypilot navigation entry:

```markdown
<!-- @cpt:root-agents -->
ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.gen/AGENTS.md` FIRST
ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md` WHEN it exists
<!-- @/cpt:root-agents -->
```

The block is inserted at the **beginning** of the file. If the file does not exist, it is created. The path inside the block reflects the actual install directory (e.g., `@/{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md`). Content between the `<!-- @cpt:root-agents -->` and `<!-- @/cpt:root-agents -->` comment markers is fully managed by Cypilot — it is overwritten on every check, so manual edits inside the block are discarded.

**Integrity invariant**: every Cypilot CLI command (not just `init`) verifies the root `AGENTS.md` block exists and is correct before proceeding. If the block is missing or the path is stale (e.g., install directory changed), the engine silently re-injects it. This guarantees that any agent opening the project will be routed to Cypilot regardless of how the IDE session started.

#### Artifact Validation

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-validate`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-validate`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ci-pipeline`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>CLI Proxy: cpt validate --artifact PRD.md
    CLI Proxy->>Skill Engine: validate command
    Skill Engine->>Config Manager: resolve system + artifact kind
    Config Manager-->>Skill Engine: system=cypilot, kind=PRD
    Skill Engine->>Validator: validate(artifact, constraints)
    Validator->>Traceability Engine: scan IDs
    Traceability Engine-->>Validator: definitions + references
    Validator->>Validator: check template structure
    Validator->>Validator: check ID formats
    Validator->>Validator: check constraints
    Validator->>Validator: check cross-references
    alt validation PASS
        Validator-->>Skill Engine: {status: PASS, warnings}
        Skill Engine-->>User: JSON report (exit code 0)
    else validation FAIL
        Validator-->>Skill Engine: {status: FAIL, errors, warnings}
        Skill Engine-->>User: JSON report with errors + fixing prompts (exit code 2)
    end
```

**Description**: Single artifact validation flow. The validator performs a single-pass scan, using the traceability engine for ID resolution, and returns a structured JSON report with PASS/FAIL status.

#### Agent Workflow Execution (Generate)

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-generate-workflow`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-create-artifact`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>AI Agent: "create PRD"
    AI Agent->>AI Agent: load SKILL.md
    AI Agent->>Skill Engine: info
    Skill Engine-->>AI Agent: system, kits, artifacts
    AI Agent->>AI Agent: load rules.md, template.md, checklist.md
    AI Agent->>User: batch questions with proposals
    User-->>AI Agent: approved inputs
    AI Agent->>AI Agent: generate artifact content
    AI Agent->>User: summary + confirmation
    User-->>AI Agent: "yes"
    AI Agent->>AI Agent: write artifact file
    AI Agent->>Skill Engine: validate --artifact <path>
    Skill Engine-->>AI Agent: validation result
    AI Agent-->>User: "✓ Written + Validated"
```

**Description**: Artifact generation is orchestrated by the AI agent, not the tool. The agent reads workflows and rules as instructions, collects information from the user, generates content, writes files, and invokes deterministic validation.

#### PR Review

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-pr-review`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-pr-review`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>AI Agent: "review PR 123"
    AI Agent->>AI Agent: check gh CLI availability
    alt gh CLI not available
        AI Agent-->>User: "gh CLI not found. Install: https://cli.github.com/"
    else gh CLI available
        AI Agent->>gh CLI: fetch PR diff, metadata, comments
        alt gh auth failure
            gh CLI-->>AI Agent: authentication error
            AI Agent-->>User: "gh not authenticated. Run: gh auth login"
        else success
            gh CLI-->>AI Agent: PR data
            AI Agent->>AI Agent: load review prompt + checklist
            AI Agent->>AI Agent: analyze changes against checklist
            AI Agent->>AI Agent: analyze reviewer comments
            AI Agent->>AI Agent: write review report
            AI Agent-->>User: summary with findings
        end
    end
```

**Description**: PR review is driven by the AI agent using `gh` CLI for data fetching. The tool provides configurable prompts and checklists; the agent performs the analysis and writes a structured report.

#### Version Update

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-update`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-update`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>CLI Proxy: cpt update
    CLI Proxy->>CLI Proxy: refresh cache if needed
    CLI Proxy->>Skill Engine: update command
    Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: copy cached skill to project
    Skill Engine->>Config Manager: migrate core.toml
    Config Manager->>Config Manager: backup + migrate
    Skill Engine->>Kit Manager: invoke kit migrations
    Kit Manager->>SDLC Plugin: migrate config/kits/sdlc/
    SDLC Plugin-->>Kit Manager: migration result
    Skill Engine->>Agent Generator: regenerate entry points
    Skill Engine-->>User: "Updated to {version}"
```

**Description**: Update copies the cached skill into the project, migrates config files (with backup), invokes kit migration scripts, and regenerates agent entry points for compatibility.

#### ID Resolution Query

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-traceability-query`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-validate`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>CLI Proxy: cpt where-defined cpt-cypilot-fr-core-init
    CLI Proxy->>Skill Engine: where-defined command
    Skill Engine->>Traceability Engine: resolve(id)
    Traceability Engine->>Traceability Engine: scan registered artifacts
    Traceability Engine-->>Skill Engine: {file, line, content}
    Skill Engine-->>User: JSON {defined_in: "architecture/PRD.md:154"}
```

**Description**: ID resolution query scans all registered artifacts to find where an ID is defined. Used by agents for navigation and by the validator for cross-reference checking.

### 3.7 Database schemas & tables

Not applicable — Cypilot does not use a database. All persistent state is stored in the filesystem:

- **`{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml`** — core config (system definitions, kit registrations, ignore lists)
- **`{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/*.toml`** — per-kit config files (autodetect rules, constraints, settings)
- **`~/.cypilot/cache/`** — global skill bundle cache
- **Markdown artifacts** — source of truth for design (PRD.md, DESIGN.md, etc.)
- **`{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml`** — artifact registry (systems, artifacts, codebases)

## 4. Additional context

### Performance Considerations

The validator uses single-pass scanning to meet the ≤ 3 second requirement. Artifacts are read once into memory, and all checks (template structure, ID format, constraints, cross-references) are performed in a single traversal. No external calls (network, database, LLM) are made during validation.

### Extensibility Model

The kit plugin system is designed for extension at three levels:

1. **Kit-level**: New kits can be created for entirely new domains (e.g., API design, infrastructure-as-code). Each kit is a self-contained package.
2. **Artifact-level**: Within a kit, new artifact kinds can be added via config. The SDLC kit supports adding custom artifact types through its plugin CLI.
3. **Resource-level**: Within an artifact kind, users can override templates, extend checklists, modify rules, and embed custom prompts. Overrides are preserved across updates.

### Migration Strategy

Config migration follows a forward-only strategy:
1. Each version of `core.toml` has a schema version field
2. Migration scripts transform config from version N to N+1
3. Kit plugins provide their own migration scripts for `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/`
4. Before any migration, a backup is created
5. If migration fails, the backup is restored and the user is notified

#### JSON → TOML Format Migration

All configuration and constraint files are migrating from JSON to TOML:

| File (old) | File (new) | Owner |
|------------|------------|-------|
| `config/core.json` | `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` | Config Manager |
| `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/*.json` | `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/*.toml` | Kit plugins |
| `constraints.json` | `constraints.toml` | Blueprint Processor (generated) |
| `.cypilot-adapter/artifacts.toml` | `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml` | Config Manager |

**Rationale**: TOML is human-readable, supports comments, and aligns with the blueprint marker format (which already uses TOML for all `@cpt:` block configurations). JSON remains the CLI output format (stdout).

**Migrator** (`cpt migrate-config`):
1. Detect existing `.json` config files in `config/` and `.cypilot-adapter/`
   - `.cypilot-adapter/artifacts.toml` migrates to `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml` (new location)
2. For each file: parse JSON → serialize as TOML → write `.toml` alongside `.json`
3. Validate the new `.toml` file against the schema
4. If validation passes: remove the `.json` file
5. If validation fails: keep `.json`, report error, skip that file
6. Generated files (`constraints.toml`) are re-generated from blueprints — no migration needed
7. The migrator runs automatically during `cpt update` when upgrading from a JSON-based version
8. Manual trigger: `cpt migrate-config` for explicit migration

**Backward compatibility**: the Config Manager reads `.toml` first; if not found, falls back to `.json` and emits a deprecation warning suggesting `cpt migrate-config`.

### Testing Approach

Component-level tests use fixture artifacts (synthetic Markdown files and TOML configs in `tests/fixtures/`). Mock boundaries:

- **Validator tests**: use fixture artifacts with known structural issues; no filesystem mocking needed (real temp files)
- **Traceability Engine tests**: use fixture artifacts with known ID patterns; verify scan results against expected definitions/references
- **Config Manager tests**: use temporary config directories; verify schema validation, serialization determinism, and migration correctness
- **CLI integration tests**: invoke the skill engine as a subprocess with fixture projects; verify JSON output and exit codes
- **Kit plugin tests**: use fixture kit directories; verify resource generation, CLI subcommand registration, and migration scripts
- **PR review tests**: mock `gh` CLI subprocess calls; verify prompt loading and report structure

Test data strategy: all test fixtures are self-contained in `tests/` — no dependency on the live `architecture/` or `config/` directories. Tests verify determinism by running the same input twice and asserting identical output.

### Non-Applicable Design Domains

The following design domains are not applicable to Cypilot and are explicitly excluded:

- **Security Architecture** (SEC): Cypilot is a local CLI tool with no authentication, authorization, or data protection requirements. It does not handle user credentials, PII, or network security. The only security consideration (no secrets in config, no untrusted code execution) is addressed in the NFR allocation.
- **Performance Architecture** (PERF): Cypilot processes single repositories locally with single-pass in-memory scanning. There is no caching strategy, database access optimization, or scalability architecture needed. The ≤ 3s validation target is met by design (single-pass, stdlib-only, no external calls).
- **Reliability Architecture** (REL): Cypilot runs as a local CLI tool, not a service. There are no fault tolerance, redundancy, or disaster recovery requirements. Config migration with backup addresses the only recoverability concern.
- **Data Architecture** (DATA): No database. All state is in the filesystem (Markdown + TOML). No data partitioning, replication, sharding, or archival needed.
- **Integration Architecture** (INT): The only external integration is `gh` CLI for PR review, which is a simple subprocess call with graceful failure handling. No integration middleware, event architecture, or API gateway needed.
- **Operations Architecture** (OPS): Installed locally via pipx. No deployment topology, container orchestration, observability infrastructure, or monitoring needed.
- **Compliance Architecture** (COMPL): No regulated data, no compliance certifications, no privacy architecture needed.
- **Usability Architecture** (UX): CLI tool with no frontend. No state management, responsive design, or progressive enhancement needed.
