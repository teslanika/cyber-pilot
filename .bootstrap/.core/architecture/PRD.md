## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Cypilot is a deterministic agent tool that embeds into AI coding assistants and CI pipelines to provide structured workflows, artifact validation, and design-to-code traceability. Cypilot maximizes determinism: everything that can be validated, checked, or enforced without an LLM is handled by deterministic scripts; the LLM is reserved only for tasks that require reasoning, creativity, or natural language understanding.

The system consists of two layers:

- **Core** — deterministic skill engine, generic workflows (generate/analyze), multi-agent integrations, global CLI, config directory management, extensible kit system, ID/traceability infrastructure, and Cypilot DSL (CDSL) for behavioral specifications
- **SDLC Kit** — artifact-first development pipeline (PRD → DESIGN → ADR → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE) with templates, checklists, examples, deterministic validation, cross-artifact consistency checks, and GitHub PR review/status workflows with configurable prompts, severity assessment, and resolved-comment audit

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

**Target Users**:
- Developers using AI coding assistants (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot) for daily work
- Technical Leads setting up development methodology and project conventions
- Teams adopting structured design-to-code workflows with AI assistance
- DevOps engineers integrating Cypilot validation into CI/CD pipelines for artifact and code quality gates

**Key Problems Solved**:
- **AI Agent Non-Determinism**: AI agents produce inconsistent results without structured guardrails; deterministic validation catches structural and traceability issues that LLMs miss or hallucinate
- **Design-Code Disconnect**: Code diverges from design when there is no single source of truth and no automated traceability enforcement
- **Fragmented Tool Setup**: Each AI agent (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot) requires different file formats for skills, workflows, and rules; maintaining these manually is error-prone
- **Inconsistent PR Reviews**: Code reviews vary in depth and focus without structured checklists and prompts; reviewers miss patterns that deterministic analysis catches
- **Manual Configuration Overhead**: Project-specific conventions, artifact locations, and validation rules require manual setup and synchronization across tools

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

**Success Criteria**:
- A new user can install Cypilot globally and initialize a project (`pipx install cypilot && cpt init`) in ≤ 5 minutes. (Baseline: not measured; Target: v2.0)
- Deterministic validation of any single artifact completes in ≤ 3 seconds on a typical developer laptop. (Baseline: ~1s current; Target: v2.0)
- 100% of `cpt-*` IDs defined in artifacts are resolvable via deterministic search (`cpt where-defined`) without ambiguity. (Baseline: 100% current; Target: v2.0)
- Agent workflow entry points for all supported agents are generated in ≤ 10 seconds via `cpt generate-agents`. (Baseline: ~5s current; Target: v2.0)
- PR review workflow produces a structured review report within 2 minutes of invocation. (Baseline: not measured; Target: v2.0)

**Capabilities**:
- Install once globally, initialize per project with interactive setup
- Execute deterministic validation and traceability scanning without LLM
- Provide structured workflows for artifact creation, analysis, and code generation
- Generate and maintain agent-specific entry points for all supported AI assistants
- Review and assess GitHub PRs with configurable prompts and checklists
- Manage project configuration through a structured config directory edited only by the tool

---

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Core

#### Global CLI Installer

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-installer`

The system MUST provide a global CLI tool installable via `pipx install git+https://github.com/cyberfabric/cyber-pilot.git`. The tool MUST be available as both `cypilot` and the short alias `cpt`. The global tool MUST have zero built-in commands — it is a pure proxy shell. On every invocation the tool MUST:

1. **Ensure cache** — maintain a local skill bundle cache (`~/.cypilot/cache/`). If no cache exists, download the latest skill bundle from the GitHub repository before proceeding. The tool MUST NOT require git as a runtime dependency.
2. **Resolve command target** — if the current directory is inside a project with an installed skill (`{cypilot_path}/` directory, default: `cypilot/`), proxy the command to the project-installed skill. Otherwise, proxy the command to the cached skill.
3. **Version check (non-blocking)** — on every invocation, check for newer versions in the background. The check MUST NOT block or delay the main command execution. Concurrent checks MUST be prevented. A newly available version becomes visible on the next invocation.
4. **Version highlight** — if the cached version is newer than the project-installed version, display a notice: "Cypilot {cached_version} available (project has {project_version}). Run `cpt update` to upgrade."

The tool MUST NOT contain any skill logic, workflow logic, or command implementations. All functionality comes from the cached or project-installed skill bundle.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Project Initialization

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-init`

The system MUST provide an interactive `cpt init` command that bootstraps Cypilot in a project. Before proceeding, the command MUST check whether Cypilot is already installed in the project. If an existing installation is detected, the command MUST NOT overwrite it — instead it MUST inform the user and propose `cpt update` if a newer version is available. The dialog MUST ask: (1) installation directory (default: `.cypilot`), (2) which agents to support (default: all available — windsurf, cursor, claude, copilot, openai). All available kits MUST be enabled by default. The command MUST create the full directory structure including skills (copied from the cache), kits, workflows, prompts, schemas, and agent-specific entry points. The command MUST define a **root system** — deriving the project name and slug from the project directory name. The command MUST create `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` (containing project root, root system definition, kit registrations) and `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml` with a fully populated root system entry including default SDLC autodetect rules for standard artifact kinds (`PRD.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `ADR/*.md`, `DECOMPOSITION.md`, `features/*.md`), default codebase entries, and ignore patterns. Installed kits MUST generate their full config in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/` — blueprints, constraints, per-artifact outputs, and workflows. The command MUST inject a managed `<!-- @cpt:root-agents -->` block at the beginning of the project root `AGENTS.md` (creating the file if absent) containing `ALWAYS open @/{install_dir}/config/AGENTS.md FIRST`. The command MUST create `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md` with default WHEN rules for standard system prompts. Every subsequent CLI invocation MUST verify the root AGENTS.md block exists and is correct, silently re-injecting it if missing or stale. After completion, the command MUST display a prompt suggestion: `cypilot on` or `cypilot help`.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Config Directory

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-config`

The system MUST maintain a `config/` directory inside the Cypilot install directory. All config files MUST be edited exclusively by the tool — never by humans directly. All config files MUST be TOML format with deterministic serialization (sorted keys, consistent formatting). The directory structure MUST be:

- **`{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml`** — core Cypilot config containing: project root, kit registrations (slug → path mapping), system definitions (name, slug, kit assignment), ignore lists. The core config MUST be versioned with a schema version field. The system MUST support migration of `core.toml` between versions automatically when the skill is updated.
- **`{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/`** — per-kit directory containing: `blueprints/` (user-editable copies of source blueprints), `constraints.toml` (kit-wide structural constraints aggregated from all artifact blueprints), `artifacts/<KIND>/` (generated per-artifact outputs: template.md, rules.md, checklist.md, example.md), `codebase/` (generated from blueprints without `artifact` key: rules.md, checklist.md), and `workflows/` (generated from `@cpt:workflow` markers). Cypilot core MUST NOT interpret kit-specific semantics — it only knows that a kit is registered and where its blueprints and generated outputs live. Autodetect rules MUST support complex nested structures: per-system root paths, per-system artifact roots with glob patterns and traceability levels, per-system codebase definitions with paths and file extensions. Autodetect MUST support hierarchical monorepos where systems can be nested (e.g., `{project_root}/examples/$system`).

Cypilot core's domain is: artifact awareness (knows artifacts exist, how to locate them via kit-provided autodetect rules), ID and traceability (format, scanning, cross-references), and kit routing (which kit owns which artifact kind).

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Deterministic Skill Engine

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-skill-engine`

The system MUST provide a Python-based deterministic skill engine as the core command executor. All commands MUST output JSON. All validation, scanning, and transformation logic MUST be deterministic (same input → same output). Exit codes MUST follow the convention: 0=PASS, 1=filesystem error, 2=FAIL. The skill MUST be self-contained and importable from the project's install directory. The skill MUST provide SKILL.md as the agent entry point with execution protocol, workflow routing, and command reference.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ci-pipeline`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Generic Workflows

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workflows`

The system MUST provide exactly two universal workflows: generate (write: create, edit, fix, update, implement) and analyze (read: validate, review, check, inspect, audit). Both workflows MUST execute a common execution protocol before their specific logic. Workflows MUST be Markdown files with frontmatter metadata, structured phases, and validation criteria. Workflows MUST support execution logging with context and message format for agent transparency. Workflows MUST NOT hardcode repository paths — all paths MUST be resolved from the config and adapter.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

#### Multi-Agent Integration

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-agents`

The system MUST provide a unified `agents` command that generates agent-specific entry points for all supported AI coding assistants. Supported agents MUST include Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot, and OpenAI. The command MUST generate workflow entry points in each agent's native format (`.windsurf/workflows/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.github/prompts/`) and skill entry points that reference the core SKILL.md. Agent selection MUST NOT be persisted in the config. The command MUST accept an optional `--agent` argument to regenerate entry points for a specific agent; without `--agent`, the command MUST regenerate entry points for all supported agents. The command always fully overwrites agent entry points on each invocation.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Extensible Kit System

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-kits`

The system MUST support extensible kit packages. Each kit is a blueprint package with the following minimum required structure:

1. **Blueprints directory** — each kit MUST provide a `blueprints/` directory containing one `.md` file per artifact kind. The filename (without `.md`) becomes the artifact kind slug (e.g., `PRD.md` → artifact kind `PRD`). This is the single source of truth for all kit resources.
2. **Installation** — during installation, the tool MUST save the kit source to `{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/` (reference copy) and copy blueprints to `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}/blueprints/` (user-editable). The Blueprint Processor MUST then generate all outputs into `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/{slug}/artifacts/<KIND>/` and `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/{slug}/workflows/`.
3. **Versioning** — each kit MUST have its own version (independent of the core Cypilot version). The version MUST be stored in the kit's `@cpt:blueprint` marker metadata.
4. **Migration** — the tool MUST support two update modes: **force** (`cypilot kit update --force`) updates the reference in `{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/`, overwrites all user blueprints, and regenerates outputs; **additive** (`cypilot kit update`, default) uses the reference (`{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/`) for a three-way diff, preserving user modifications. New markers are inserted; deleted markers stay deleted; user-modified sections are preserved. After merge, the reference is updated.
5. **SKILL extensions** — a kit MAY include `@cpt:skill` markers in blueprints that extend the core SKILL.md with kit-specific commands and workflows.
6. **System prompt extensions** — a kit MAY include `@cpt:system-prompt` markers in blueprints that are automatically loaded when the kit's artifacts or workflows are used.
7. **Workflow registrations** — a kit MAY include `@cpt:workflow` markers in blueprints that generate workflow files and agent entry points.

**User extensibility**: users MUST be able to edit blueprints in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}/blueprints/` and regenerate outputs with `cpt generate-resources`. User modifications MUST be preserved across additive kit updates using the reference in `{cypilot_path}/kits/{slug}/` for three-way diff.

Kit installation MUST register the kit in `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml`, create the kit's directory structure in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/`, and generate all resources. The system MUST provide CLI commands to: install kits, update kits, and create new custom kits. The `validate-kits` command MUST validate that kit packages are structurally correct (have a `blueprints/` directory with valid blueprint files).

> **Plugin system** (Python entry points, custom CLI subcommands, validation hooks, generation hooks) is planned for p2.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Artifact Blueprint

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-blueprint`

The system MUST provide an **Artifact Blueprint** — a core contract defining a single-source-of-truth file per artifact kind from which all kit resources are generated. The blueprint MUST serve as both the artifact template and the specification for that artifact kind. The core MUST define the blueprint format, provide a blueprint processor, and enforce the contract across all kits.

The core blueprint contract MUST require only one mandatory output: `rules.md` (agent instructions for generate and analyze workflows). All other outputs are kit-defined — each kit registers its own generation targets (e.g., the SDLC kit registers template, checklist, constraints; another kit may register different file types). The core MUST provide an extension point for kits to register custom blueprint marker types and their corresponding output generators.

The tool MUST generate the initial blueprint and MUST be able to update it on kit upgrades. The tool MUST detect which parts of the blueprint the user has modified and MUST NOT overwrite those modifications. New markers added by the tool MUST be inserted without affecting user content. Markers deleted by the user MUST NOT be re-added. Users MUST be able to customize any part of the blueprint and all customizations MUST be preserved across updates. New artifact kinds MUST be creatable by adding a new blueprint.

The blueprint MUST support optional **SKILL extensions** — sections that extend the main SKILL.md with kit-specific commands, workflows, and capabilities. When a kit's blueprint defines a SKILL extension, it MUST be automatically integrated into the agent-facing SKILL.md so that AI agents discover kit capabilities without additional configuration.

The blueprint MUST support optional **system prompt extensions** — sections that provide additional context or instructions to AI agents when working with that artifact kind. These extensions MUST be automatically loaded by the generate and analyze workflows when processing the corresponding artifact.

The blueprint MUST support optional **workflow registrations** — structured definitions of workflows that agents can execute. Each workflow declared in a blueprint MUST be generated as a workflow `.md` file in the kit's `workflows/` directory. During agent entry point generation (`cpt generate-agents`), each workflow MUST get an entry point in every supported agent's native format (e.g., `.windsurf/workflows/cypilot-{name}.md`) that references the kit workflow file. Workflow names MUST be unique across all blueprints.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### ID and Traceability System

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-traceability`

The system MUST provide a unique ID system for all design elements using structured format `cpt-{system-slug}-{kind}-{slug}`. This is the core domain of Cypilot: the core knows that artifacts exist, knows how to locate them (via autodetect rules provided by kits), knows which kit owns which artifact kind, and owns the ID format, scanning, and cross-reference resolution. The system MUST support code tags (`@cpt-*`) linking implementation to design. Traceability validation MUST be configurable per artifact (FULL or DOCS-ONLY). The system MUST provide commands: `list-ids`, `list-id-kinds`, `get-content`, `where-defined`, `where-used`. IDs MAY be versioned by appending `-vN` suffix. When an ID is replaced, references MUST be updated across all artifacts and code. Cross-artifact validation MUST check: covered_by references resolve, checked references imply checked definitions, and all ID references resolve to definitions. Artifact-specific validation logic (template compliance, structural rules) is delegated to the owning kit's plugin.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ci-pipeline`

#### Cypilot DSL (CDSL)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-cdsl`

The system MUST define a plain English behavioral specification language (CDSL) for actor flows, algorithms, and state descriptions. CDSL MUST use structured numbered lists with bold keywords (**IF**, **ELSE**, **WHILE**, **FOR EACH**, **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, **MUST**, **REQUIRED**, **OPTIONAL**). CDSL MUST support instruction markers with checkboxes (`- [ ] Inst-label: description`) and phase-based organization (`p1`, `p2`, etc.) for implementation tracking. CDSL MUST be readable by non-programmers for validation and review. CDSL MUST translate directly to code with traceability tags. CDSL MUST be actor-centric (steps start with **Actor** or **System**).

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

#### Version Detection and Updates

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-version`

The `cpt update` command MUST update the project-installed skill to the version currently in the cache (`~/.cypilot/cache/`). The update MUST automatically migrate `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` between versions, preserving all user settings. Each kit's migration script MUST be invoked to migrate its own config files. The update MUST regenerate agent entry points for compatibility. If the cache is outdated, the update MUST first download the latest release archive from GitHub before applying. Version information MUST be accessible via `cpt --version` (shows both cache and project versions). The system MUST support `cpt update --check` to show available updates without applying them.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### CLI Configuration Interface

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-cli-config`

The system MUST provide rich CLI commands for project configuration without manual file editing. Core CLI commands MUST support: managing system definitions in `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` (add/remove/rename systems, assign kits), managing the ignore list (add/remove patterns with reasons), and registering/installing kits. Kit-specific config changes MUST be delegated to the kit's plugin CLI commands. For example, the SDLC kit plugin provides commands for managing autodetect rules per system (artifact patterns, traceability levels, codebase paths, file extensions) — the core CLI does not interpret these structures. All config changes MUST go through the tool to maintain config integrity and versioning. The CLI MUST provide dry-run mode for config changes. The CLI MUST support reading current config values (e.g., `cpt config show`, `cpt sdlc autodetect show --system cypilot`).

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Template Quality Assurance

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-template-qa`

The system MUST provide a `self-check` command that validates example artifacts against their templates. When validation level is STRICT, the self-check command MUST validate that the example artifact passes all template validation rules. This ensures that templates and examples remain synchronized and that templates are valid.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Table of Contents Management

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-toc`

The system MUST provide `cpt toc` and `cpt validate-toc` commands for Markdown table of contents management. `cpt toc` MUST generate or update `<!-- toc -->` blocks with GitHub-compatible anchor slugs, fenced code block awareness, and configurable heading level ranges. `cpt validate-toc` MUST verify that TOC exists, anchors point to real headings, all headings are covered, and the TOC is not stale. Both commands MUST support batch processing of multiple files and output JSON results. The TOC engine is also used internally by the Blueprint Processor for generated artifact templates.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Environment Diagnostics

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-doctor`

The system MUST provide a `cpt doctor` command that checks environment health: Python version compatibility, git availability, `gh` CLI authentication status, agent detection (which supported agents are present), config directory integrity validation, skill version status, and kit structural correctness. The command MUST output a clear pass/fail report with actionable remediation steps for each failed check.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Pre-Commit Hook Integration

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-hooks`

#### VS Code Plugin

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-vscode-plugin`

The system MUST provide a VS Code extension (compatible with VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf) for IDE-native Cypilot support. The plugin MUST provide:

1. **ID Syntax Highlighting** — `cpt-*` identifiers MUST be visually distinguished in Markdown files (definitions, references, and code tags `@cpt-*`) with configurable color scheme.
2. **Go to Definition / Find References** — clicking a `cpt-*` reference MUST navigate to its definition; clicking a definition MUST show all references across the workspace (equivalent to `where-defined` / `where-used`).
3. **Real-Time Validation** — artifact documents MUST be validated on save (or on keystroke with debounce) against their template structure; validation issues MUST appear as VS Code diagnostics (errors, warnings) with inline squiggles and Problems panel entries.
4. **ID Autocompletion** — typing `cpt-` MUST trigger autocompletion with all known IDs from the project registry, grouped by kind (actor, fr, nfr, usecase, etc.).
5. **Hover Information** — hovering over a `cpt-*` ID MUST show a tooltip with: definition location, artifact kind, priority, checked/unchecked status, and first line of content.
6. **Cross-Artifact Link Lens** — CodeLens annotations above ID definitions MUST show reference count and covered_by status (e.g., "3 references · covered by DESIGN, DECOMPOSITION").
7. **Traceability Tree View** — a sidebar panel MUST display the traceability tree: PRD → DESIGN → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE, with checked/unchecked status per ID and click-to-navigate.
8. **Validation Status Bar** — the status bar MUST show current artifact validation status (PASS/FAIL with error count) and click to run full validation.
9. **Quick Fix Actions** — common validation issues (missing priority marker, placeholder detected, duplicate ID) MUST offer quick fix suggestions via VS Code Quick Fix API.
10. **Config-Aware** — the plugin MUST read the Cypilot config from the project's install directory to resolve systems, kits, autodetect rules, and ignore lists. The plugin MUST NOT require separate configuration.

The plugin MUST delegate all validation logic to the installed Cypilot skill (`cpt validate`) to ensure consistency between CLI and IDE results. The plugin MUST support workspace with multiple systems.

**Actors**:

### 5.2 SDLC Kit

#### Artifact Pipeline

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-pipeline`

The SDLC kit MUST provide an artifact-first development pipeline: PRD → DESIGN → ADR → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE. Each artifact kind MUST have a template, checklist, rules, and at least one example. Each artifact kind MUST be usable independently (no forced sequence). The kit MUST support both greenfield (design-first) and brownfield (code-first) projects.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

#### SDLC Kit

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-plugin`

The SDLC kit MUST provide a blueprint package with artifact definitions for PRD, DESIGN, ADR, DECOMPOSITION, and FEATURE in `kits/sdlc/blueprints/`. The Blueprint Processor generates all outputs from these blueprints using the core Artifact Blueprint contract (`cpt-cypilot-fr-core-blueprint`). The SDLC kit MUST:

1. **Blueprint definitions** — provide blueprints using SDLC-specific marker types: `@cpt:heading` and `@cpt:id` (→ kit-wide `constraints.toml`), `@cpt:check` (→ `checklist.md`), `@cpt:prompt` (→ `template.md` writing instructions), `@cpt:rule` (→ `rules.md`), `@cpt:example` (→ `example.md`). The `@cpt:heading` + `@cpt:prompt` markers generate `template.md`. Codebase blueprints (without `artifact` key) generate `codebase/rules.md` and `codebase/checklist.md`.
2. **Artifact type control** — the kit owns and controls all its artifact types via blueprints. New artifact types MAY be added by creating a new blueprint `.md` file in the kit's `blueprints/` directory.
3. **SKILL extensions** — blueprints MUST include `@cpt:skill` sections so that SDLC-specific commands and workflows are discoverable by AI agents via the main SKILL.md.
4. **Workflow registrations** — blueprints MUST include `@cpt:workflow` sections that generate workflow files and agent entry points for generate, analyze, and review operations.
5. **Update compatibility** — user customizations in blueprints (in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/sdlc/blueprints/`) MUST be preserved across kit version updates via the reference-based three-way diff. Conflicts between user changes and kit updates MUST be flagged for manual resolution.

> Kit-specific CLI subcommands, validation hooks, and config extensibility are planned for p2.

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `cpt init` completes interactive setup and creates a working `{cypilot_path}/` directory (default: `cypilot/`) in ≤ 5 minutes
- [ ] Deterministic validation output is actionable (clear file/line/pointer for every issue)
- [ ] All supported agents receive correct entry points after `cpt generate-agents`
- [ ] `cpt doctor` reports environment health with pass/fail per check
- [ ] Config is never manually edited — all changes go through the CLI tool
- [ ] PR review workflow produces a structured report matching the template format

## 10. Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Criticality |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Python 3.11+ | Runtime for CLI tool and skill engine (requires `tomllib` from stdlib) | p1 |
| Git | Project detection, skill installation, version control | p1 |
| pipx | Global CLI installation (recommended) | p2 |
| gh CLI | GitHub API access for PR review/status workflows | p2 |

## 11. Assumptions

- AI coding assistants (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot) can follow structured markdown workflows with embedded instructions.
- Developers have access to Python 3.11+ for running the Cypilot CLI tool.
- Projects use Git for version control (project detection relies on `.git` directory).
- Teams are willing to maintain design artifacts as part of their development workflow.
- The `pipx` package manager is available or installable for global CLI installation.
- GitHub is the primary VCS platform for PR review workflows (other platforms may be supported later).

### Open Questions

No open questions remain at this time — all architectural questions (config directory structure, kit structure, PR review placement in SDLC kit) were resolved during PRD development.

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AI agent variability | Inconsistent artifact quality across different agents | Deterministic validation catches structural issues; checklists enforce quality baseline |
| Adoption resistance | Teams bypass the workflow or skip validation | Incremental adoption via brownfield support; immediate value from validation and PR review |
| Kit rigidity | Templates don't fit all project types | Kit extension system allows custom overrides; custom kits can be created from scratch |
| Version fragmentation | Different team members have different skill versions | Version detection on every invocation; config migration ensures backward compatibility |
| Git dependency for skill updates | Network required for skill installation and updates | Skill is installed once and works offline; updates are optional and explicit |
