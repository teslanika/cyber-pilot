## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

Cypilot uses a layered architecture with a thin global CLI proxy at the top, a deterministic skill engine at the core, and a kit system for domain-specific functionality. The architecture maximizes determinism: all validation, scanning, and transformation is handled by Python scripts with JSON output; LLMs are reserved only for reasoning tasks within agent workflows.

The system separates concerns into five layers: Global CLI Proxy (installation, caching, version management), Core Skill Engine (command routing, deterministic execution), Kit System (GitHub-based kit installation, domain-specific file packages: rules, templates, checklists, constraints, workflows), Config Management (structured config directory, schema validation), and Agent Integration (multi-agent entry point generation). Each layer has clear boundaries and communicates through well-defined interfaces.

Each kit is a file package: a collection of artifact definitions (rules, checklists, templates, examples, constraints, workflows, scripts) installable from GitHub repositories and copied into the kit's config directory (default: `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/`) during installation. Kit updates use file-level diff: each file in the new kit version is compared against the user's installed copy, and changed files are presented as unified diffs with interactive accept/decline/modify prompts. All kit files are user-editable and preserved across updates via interactive diff. The core knows about kits through registration in `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` (with `source` and `version` fields tracking the GitHub origin). Cypilot core does not bundle any domain-specific kits — all kits are external packages. During `cpt init`, the user is prompted to install the SDLC kit (`cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`) with `[a]ccept / [d]ecline`. A plugin system for custom hooks and CLI subcommands is planned for p2.

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

##### Global CLI Installer

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-installer`

**Design Response**: Thin proxy shell with local cache at `~/.cypilot/cache/`. On every invocation the proxy ensures a cached skill bundle exists, routes commands to the project-installed or cached skill, and performs non-blocking background version checks. The proxy contains zero skill logic.

##### Project Initialization

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-init`

**Design Response**: Interactive bootstrapper that copies the skill from cache into the project, creates the `config/` and `.gen/` directory structure, and generates agent entry points. The dialog asks for install directory, agent selection, and per-kit config output directory. Installed kits copy all kit files (rules, templates, checklists, examples, constraints, workflows, scripts) into the kit's config directory.

##### Config Directory

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-config`

**Design Response**: The config directory (`{cypilot_path}/config/`) holds all project configuration. `core.toml` stores the project root and kit registrations (format, path, version, source, resource bindings for manifest-driven kits). `artifacts.toml` stores the artifact registry — including system definitions (name, slug, kit), autodetect rules, ignore patterns, and codebase definitions. System identity is defined exclusively in `artifacts.toml` `[[systems]]` (see `cpt-cypilot-adr-remove-system-from-core-toml`). `AGENTS.md` and `SKILL.md` are user-editable extension points for agent navigation rules and skill instructions respectively. `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/` directories hold all kit files — artifacts, workflows, per-kit SKILL.md, constraints, and scripts (all user-editable). Kit-specific config files (e.g., `pr-review.toml`) also live in `config/`. `{cypilot_path}/.gen/` holds only auto-generated aggregate files (`AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md`, `README.md`) assembled from installed kits. All TOML config files use deterministic serialization. Kit files are user-editable and preserved across updates via interactive diff.

##### Deterministic Skill Engine

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-skill-engine`

**Design Response**: Python command router that dispatches to command handlers. All commands output JSON. Exit codes follow the convention: 0=PASS, 1=filesystem error, 2=FAIL. SKILL.md serves as the agent entry point with command reference and execution protocol.

##### Generic Workflows

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workflows`

**Design Response**: Two universal Markdown workflows (generate and analyze) with a common execution protocol. Workflows are loaded and interpreted by AI agents, not by the tool itself. The tool provides deterministic commands that workflows invoke.

##### Execution Plans

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-execution-plans`

**Design Response**: A third universal Markdown workflow (`plan.md`) that extends the generate/analyze system with phase-based task decomposition. The plan workflow reads all kit dependencies (template, rules, checklist, constraints) for the target artifact, decomposes the task into phases using type-specific strategies (template sections for generation, checklist categories for analysis, CDSL blocks for implementation), and "compiles" each phase into a self-contained phase file. Phase files are compiled prompts: all rules, constraints, and context are pre-resolved and inlined so the file requires zero external references. Phase files follow a strict template (`requirements/plan-template.md`) with TOML frontmatter, inlined rules, binary acceptance criteria, and a completion report format. Decomposition strategies are defined in `requirements/plan-decomposition.md`. Plans are stored in `{cypilot_path}/.plans/{task-slug}/` (git-ignored) with a `plan.toml` manifest tracking phase lifecycle. No Python code or CLI commands — purely prompt-level, agent-interpreted. Budget enforcement: ≤500 lines target, ≤1000 max per phase file.

##### Multi-Agent Integration

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-agents`

**Design Response**: Agent Generator component produces entry points in each agent's native format: `.windsurf/workflows/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.github/prompts/`. All entry points reference the core SKILL.md. The `agents` command fully overwrites entry points on each invocation.

##### Extensible Kit System

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-kits`

**Design Response**: Kit Manager handles kit lifecycle: installation from GitHub repositories (`cpt kit install --github <owner/repo>`), copying kit files into the kit's config directory, registration in `core.toml` (with config path, GitHub source, and version), and version tracking via GitHub tags. Each kit is a collection of ready-to-use files (rules, templates, checklists, examples, constraints, workflows, scripts). Kit updates download the new version from GitHub and use file-level diff: each file in the new version is compared against the user's installed copy, and all changed files are presented as unified diffs with interactive accept/decline/accept-all/decline-all/modify prompts. `cpt kit move-config <slug>` relocates a kit's config output directory. Cypilot core bundles no kits — all kits are external GitHub packages. A plugin system for custom CLI subcommands and hooks is planned for p2.

##### Declarative Kit Installation Manifest

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-kit-manifest`

**Design Response**: A kit MAY include a declarative installation manifest (`manifest.toml`) at its root. When present, the manifest governs the entire installation and update process — only resources declared in the manifest are installed, and each resource is placed at its declared (or user-overridden) path. When absent, the Kit Manager falls back to the current behavior: copy predefined content directories (`artifacts/`, `codebase/`, `scripts/`, `workflows/`) and content files (`constraints.toml`, `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`) into the kit's config directory.

The manifest declares every resource the kit provides. Each resource has: an **identifier** (e.g., `adr_template_path`) used as a template variable `{adr_template_path}` in kit files and workflows, a **source** path (relative to kit package root), a **default destination** (relative to kit root), a **type** (`file` or `directory`), and a **`user_modifiable`** flag. If `user_modifiable = true`, the system prompts the user for the destination path during installation (offering the default); if `false`, the resource is placed at the default path silently.

The manifest also declares a **kit root** (`root`) — the base directory for all resources (default: `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}`). The kit root itself is user-modifiable during installation, allowing the entire kit to be relocated.

**Resolved resource paths** are stored in `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` under the kit's `[kits.{slug}.resources]` section as `identifier = "resolved_path"` pairs. All paths are **always relative to `{cypilot_path}`** (the adapter directory) — absolute paths are never stored. Paths may contain `..` components for resources placed outside the adapter tree (e.g., `../architecture/templates/ADR/template.md`). These paths are the single source of truth for where kit resources live in the project. At runtime, each binding is resolved to an absolute path via `({cypilot_path} / binding).resolve()`. The `cpt info` command outputs all resolved resource variables for each installed kit, enabling agents and scripts to discover resource locations programmatically.

**Template variable resolution**: Kit files (rules.md, SKILL.md, workflows, etc.) and the execution protocol can reference resource identifiers as `{identifier}` template variables. During installation, variables in kit files are resolved to their final paths. During workflow execution (generate/analyze), the execution protocol resolves resource variables from `core.toml` so that agents always operate on the correct paths regardless of user customization.

**Update behavior**: On `cpt kit update`, the Kit Manager reads the manifest from the new kit version and the stored resource paths from `core.toml`. Existing resources are updated at their registered paths via file-level diff. New resources (present in the new manifest but not in `core.toml`) trigger an interactive prompt asking the user for a destination path, then register the path. Removed resources (present in `core.toml` but absent from the new manifest) produce a warning; the path registration is preserved in `core.toml` (no auto-deletion of user files).

**Legacy install migration**: When a kit update introduces a `manifest.toml` but the existing `core.toml` kit entry has no `[kits.{slug}.resources]` section (legacy install with only a root `path`), the Kit Manager auto-populates all resource bindings by computing each resource's path from the existing kit root + the manifest's `default_path` values. This ensures all tracked resources are registered without requiring re-installation. User-modifiable resources that already exist at their computed default paths are registered silently; only truly new resources (files not present on disk) trigger a path prompt.

**Manifest format** (`manifest.toml`):

```toml
[manifest]
version = "1.0"
root = "{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}"
user_modifiable = true

[[resources]]
id = "adr_artifacts"
description = "ADR artifact definitions (template, rules, checklist, examples)"
source = "artifacts/ADR"
default_path = "artifacts/ADR"
type = "directory"
user_modifiable = true

[[resources]]
id = "constraints"
description = "Kit structural constraints"
source = "constraints.toml"
default_path = "constraints.toml"
type = "file"
user_modifiable = false
```

**Validation**: The manifest is validated against `kit-manifest.schema.json` during kit installation and update. Schema checks: all `id` values are unique, all `source` paths exist in the kit package, `default_path` values are valid relative paths, `type` matches the actual source (file vs directory).

##### ID and Traceability System

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-traceability`

**Design Response**: Traceability Engine scans artifacts for `cpt-{system}-{kind}-{slug}` IDs, resolves cross-references, detects code tags (`@cpt-*`), and provides query commands (list-ids, where-defined, where-used, get-content). Validation enforces constraints from `constraints.toml`.

##### Cypilot DSL (CDSL)

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-cdsl`

**Design Response**: CDSL is a plain English specification language embedded in Markdown. The tool parses CDSL instruction markers (`- [ ] Inst-label:`) for implementation tracking. CDSL validation is part of the Validator component's template compliance checks.

##### SDLC Kit & Related Requirements (EXTRACTED — External Package)

> **EXTRACTED per `cpt-cypilot-adr-extract-sdlc-kit`**: The SDLC kit has been moved to a separate GitHub repository (`cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`). All SDLC-specific design responses (kit plugin, artifact validation, PR review workflow) are now owned by the kit's own repository. Cypilot core prompts to install this kit during `cpt init` with `[a]ccept / [d]ecline`. The core Validator component provides generic structural and cross-artifact validation for any installed kit's artifacts.

##### Version Detection and Updates

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-version`

**Design Response**: The `update` command copies the cached skill into the project, detects directory layout and automatically restructures if the old layout is detected, migrates `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` (including removal of the legacy `[system]` section per `cpt-cypilot-adr-remove-system-from-core-toml`), migrates bundled kit references to GitHub sources for projects upgrading from versions < 3.0.8 (see `cpt-cypilot-adr-extract-sdlc-kit`), and regenerates agent entry points. The update command does NOT update kit files — kit updates are a separate operation via `cpt kit update`. Config migration preserves all user settings. Version information is accessible via `--version`.

##### CLI Configuration Interface

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-cli-config`

**Design Response**: Core CLI commands manage `core.toml` (kit registrations, resource bindings, ignore lists) and `artifacts.toml` (system definitions, autodetect rules). System identity is managed in `artifacts.toml` only (see `cpt-cypilot-adr-remove-system-from-core-toml`). All config changes are validated against schemas before application. Dry-run mode is supported. Kit-specific CLI subcommands are planned for p2.

##### VS Code Plugin

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-vscode-plugin`

**Design Response**: VS Code extension delegates all validation to the installed Cypilot skill (`cpt validate`). The plugin reads config from the project's install directory, provides ID syntax highlighting, go-to-definition, real-time validation, autocompletion, hover info, CodeLens, traceability tree view, and quick fixes.

##### Artifact Pipeline (EXTRACTED — External Package)

> **EXTRACTED per `cpt-cypilot-adr-extract-sdlc-kit`**: The SDLC artifact pipeline is now defined by the SDLC kit (`cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`). Cypilot core provides generic generate/analyze workflows that work with any installed kit.

##### Artifact Blueprint (DEPRECATED)

- [x] `p1` - ~~cpt-cypilot-fr-core-blueprint~~ (DEPRECATED)

> **DEPRECATED per `cpt-cypilot-adr-remove-blueprint-system`**: The Blueprint Processor and blueprint files have been removed. Kits are now direct file packages — all kit resources (rules, templates, checklists, examples, constraints, workflows, scripts, SKILL.md) are maintained as ready-to-use files in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/`. There is no generation step. Kit updates use file-level diff (see `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-resource-diff`).

**Kit file structure**: Each kit is a directory containing per-artifact subdirectories (`artifacts/<KIND>/rules.md`, `artifacts/<KIND>/template.md`, `artifacts/<KIND>/checklist.md`, `artifacts/<KIND>/examples/example.md`), kit-wide files (`constraints.toml`, `conf.toml`, `SKILL.md`), and optional directories (`workflows/`, `scripts/`, `codebase/`). All files are user-editable and preserved across updates via interactive diff.

**SKILL extensions**: Kit `SKILL.md` files in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/SKILL.md` are aggregated into `{cypilot_path}/config/SKILL.md` during init/kit-install. The main SKILL.md navigates to `{cypilot_path}/config/SKILL.md`, ensuring AI agents discover kit capabilities.

**System prompt extensions**: Kit `AGENTS.md` content is appended to `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md` during init/kit-install. Loaded via Protocol Guard, directives are automatically active.

**Workflow registrations**: Kit workflow files in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/workflows/{name}.md` are registered with the Agent Generator, which creates entry points in each agent's native format (e.g., `.windsurf/workflows/cypilot-{name}.md`).

##### Generated Resource Editing & Interactive Diff

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-resource-diff`

**Design Response**: The Resource Diff Engine handles interactive conflict resolution for kit file updates and generated resource regeneration. The engine compares source files against the user's installed copies. If content differs, it presents a unified diff (similar to `git diff`) and an interactive CLI prompt with five modes: `[a]ccept` (overwrite with new), `[d]ecline` (keep current), `[A]ccept-all` (overwrite all remaining), `[D]ecline-all` (keep all remaining), `[m]odify` (open the file in the user's editor for manual resolution). Before iterating per-file, the engine displays a summary of all changes (added, removed, modified, unchanged counts). The same engine is used for both kit updates and generated resource regeneration.

##### Directory Layout Migration

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-layout-migration`

**Design Response**: The Layout Migrator is a component in the Kit Manager that detects the old directory layout and performs automatic restructuring (generated outputs from `.gen/kits/` to `config/kits/`). This is an internal v3 restructuring, not a version bump. Detection: if `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/{slug}/` exists → old layout. Migration steps: (1) backup affected directories, (2) move `.gen/kits/{slug}/` → `config/kits/{slug}/` (generated outputs), (3) remove old `kits/{slug}/` reference copies if present, (4) remove `.gen/kits/` directory (preserve `.gen/AGENTS.md`, `.gen/SKILL.md`, `.gen/README.md`), (5) update `core.toml` kit registrations. Rollback: if any step fails, restore from backup and report error. Runs automatically during `cpt update`.

##### Remaining SDLC Requirements (EXTRACTED — External Package)

> **EXTRACTED per `cpt-cypilot-adr-extract-sdlc-kit`**: All remaining SDLC-specific requirements (cross-artifact validation, PR status, code generation, brownfield support, feature lifecycle, PR config, quickstart guides) have been moved to the SDLC kit repository (`cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`). The core Validator provides generic cross-artifact validation for any installed kit.

##### Utility Commands

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-toc`
- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-template-qa`
- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-doctor`
- [ ] `p3` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-hooks`
- [ ] `p3` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-completions`

**Design Response**: Utility commands are implemented as standalone handlers in the Skill Engine with no architectural impact beyond the standard command routing pattern. `self-check` validates examples against templates. `doctor` checks environment health (Python version, git, gh, agents, config integrity). `hook install/uninstall` manages git pre-commit hooks for lightweight validation. `completions install` generates shell completion scripts for bash/zsh/fish.

##### Spec Coverage

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-traceability`

**Design Response**: The `spec-coverage` command reuses the Traceability Engine's code scanning infrastructure to measure two metrics: **coverage percentage** (ratio of lines within `@cpt-begin`/`@cpt-end` blocks to total effective lines) and **granularity score** (instruction density — ideally 1 block marker per 10 lines). Output mirrors `coverage.py` JSON format with per-file and summary statistics. Threshold enforcement via `--min-coverage` and `--min-granularity` flags enables CI gating. Implementation lives in `skills/.../utils/coverage.py` (scanner + metrics) and `skills/.../commands/spec_coverage.py` (CLI entry point).

##### Multi-Repo Workspace Federation

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace`
- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-traceability`
- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace-git-sources`
- [x] `p1` - `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace-cross-repo-editing`

**Design Response**: Workspace federation enables cross-repo artifact traceability without merging adapters. The architecture introduces five new data types — `WorkspaceConfig`, `SourceEntry`, `TraceabilityConfig`, `ResolveConfig`, `NamespaceRule` — and two runtime types — `WorkspaceContext` (wraps `CypilotContext`) and `SourceContext`. Context loading gains a workspace upgrade step: after building the primary `CypilotContext`, `WorkspaceContext.load()` discovers workspace config via the core.toml `workspace` key (string path or inline dict). Each named source is resolved to a `SourceContext` with reachability status. `resolve_artifact_path` returns `Optional[Path]` — `None` when a source is explicitly set but unreachable, preventing silent fallback to local paths. Two traceability settings (`cross_repo`, `resolve_remote_ids`) independently control path resolution and remote ID expansion. CLI commands (`workspace-init`, `workspace-add` with `--inline` flag for inline mode, `workspace-info`, `workspace-sync`) manage workspace config, while `validate --local-only` restricts to single-repo mode and `list-ids --source` filters by source. Scan failures emit stderr warnings rather than silently swallowing exceptions.

**Git URL sources**: Standalone workspace files (`.cypilot-workspace.toml`) gain Git URL source support alongside local paths. `SourceEntry` extends with optional `url` and `branch` fields. A new `ResolveConfig` (with `workdir`, `namespace_rules`) and `NamespaceRule` (host pattern → `{org}/{repo}` path template) govern how URLs map to local directory paths. The resolution algorithm (`cpt-cypilot-algo-workspace-resolve-git-url`) parses the URL, applies namespace templating, and either returns the path to an existing local clone or performs a fresh `git clone` via `subprocess` (stdlib-only). Existing repos are never fetched during resolution — use `workspace-sync` to explicitly update worktrees. Inline workspace definitions reject `url` fields — inline mode stays local-paths-only. `path` and `url` are mutually exclusive (enforced by CLI via `argparse`).

**Cross-repo editing**: When editing files in a remote source, the system applies the remote source's own adapter context rather than the primary repo's. `SourceContext` gains a lazy-loaded `adapter_context` field holding the source's full `CypilotContext`. Three algorithms drive this: `cpt-cypilot-algo-workspace-resolve-git-url` takes a `SourceEntry`, `ResolveConfig`, and workspace parent path, parses the URL, applies namespace templating, and returns `Optional[Path]` to a local clone (None on unparseable URL, path traversal, or clone failure). `cpt-cypilot-algo-workspace-resolve-adapter-context` takes a `SourceContext` and returns `Optional[CypilotContext]` — loads a source's adapter (config, kits, templates, rules, constraints) on first access with result cached on `SourceContext` (None when unreachable, missing adapter dir, or load failure). `cpt-cypilot-algo-workspace-determine-target` takes a target file path and `WorkspaceContext`, matches the path to a source via longest-prefix match, and returns `(Optional[SourceContext], CypilotContext)` — `(None, primary)` when no source matches, `(sc, primary)` when matched but no adapter. When a remote source has no Cypilot adapter, the system falls back to the primary repo's adapter for that source. The primary repo's adapter remains active for workspace-level operations and its own files.

#### NFR Allocation

| NFR ID | NFR Summary | Allocated To | Design Response | Verification Approach |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-validation-performance` | Single artifact validation ≤ 3s | `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` | Single-pass scanning, no external calls, in-memory processing, no LLM dependency | Benchmark test with largest project artifact |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-security-integrity` | No untrusted code execution, deterministic results, no secrets in config | `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager`, `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` | Validator reads files as text only — no eval/exec. Config Manager rejects files containing known secret patterns. All commands are pure functions of input state | Determinism test: same repo state → same validation output |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-reliability-recoverability` | Actionable failure guidance, no settings loss on migration | `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager`, `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` | Config migration creates backup before applying changes. All error messages include file path, line number, and remediation steps | Migration test: upgrade config across 3 versions, verify no settings lost |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-adoption-usability` | ≤ 5 decisions in init, ≤ 3 clarifying questions per workflow | `cpt-cypilot-component-cli-proxy`, `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` | Init uses sensible defaults (all agents, all kits). CLI provides `--help` with usage examples for every command | Count decisions in init flow; count agent questions per workflow |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-dry` | Every rule configured in exactly one place; no duplication | `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager`, `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager` | Config is the single source of truth; kit constraints reference config, never duplicate it. Kit files are user-editable originals, not copies | Review config + constraints for duplicate rule definitions |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-simplicity` | No unnecessary abstractions; minimal dependencies | All components | Python stdlib-only (see `cpt-cypilot-adr-python-stdlib-only`). Each component has a single responsibility. New abstractions require explicit justification | Dependency audit; component responsibility review |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-ci-automation-first` | CLI tool usable in CI without human interaction; deterministic operations | `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine`, `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` | All validation and scanning commands are deterministic pure functions. Exit codes follow convention (0=PASS, 2=FAIL). Machine-readable output for all commands | CI integration test: run validation in non-interactive mode |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-zero-harm` | No process imposition; lint pattern; no breakage | `cpt-cypilot-component-validator`, `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` | Validator is advisory — never modifies files. Workflows are opt-in. Kit rules are configurable. Tool never touches code, builds, or tests | Verify no file mutations during validation; verify custom kit support |
| `cpt-cypilot-nfr-upgradability` | Single-command upgrade; backward compatible; user edits preserved | `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager`, `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` | Kit updates use file-level diff with interactive prompts. Config migration creates backup and preserves all user settings. `.core/` replaced atomically | Upgrade test: modify kit files, upgrade, verify edits preserved |

#### Architecture Decisions

The following architecture decision records (ADRs) drive the design:

- `cpt-cypilot-adr-prefer-cpt-cli-for-agents` — prefer `cpt` CLI over direct script invocation in agent prompts; graceful fallback to raw Python path
- `cpt-cypilot-adr-ai-cli-extensibility-subagents` — generate isolated subagent definitions (codegen, PR review) for tools that support them; Claude Code as canonical format with per-tool adaptation
- `cpt-cypilot-adr-execution-plans` — automated execution plans with compiled phase files for context-bounded agent tasks; decomposition by template sections, checklist categories, or CDSL blocks

### 1.3 Architecture Layers

The architecture is organized into five layers stacked top-to-bottom, where each layer depends only on the layer directly below it.

At the top sits the **AI Agent layer** — external coding assistants (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex) that read SKILL.md as their entry point and invoke Cypilot commands. Immediately below is the **Agent Entry Points layer**: generated files in agent-native directories (`.windsurf/`, `.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.github/`) that contain workflow proxies and skill shims translating agent-specific formats into Cypilot CLI calls.

The **Global CLI Proxy layer** (`cypilot` / `cpt`, installed via pipx) is a thin stateless shell. It resolves the target skill — either from the project's local install directory or from the global cache (`~/.cypilot/cache/`) — and forwards the invocation. The proxy contains zero skill logic.

Below the proxy is the **Core Skill Engine layer** — the heart of the system. It owns the command router, JSON output serialization, SKILL.md, workflows, and the execution protocol. Three core components live here: the **Validator** (deterministic structural and cross-artifact checks), the **Traceability Engine** (ID scanning, resolution, and coverage analysis), and the **Config Manager** (schema-validated TOML config read/write with migration support; system identity sourced from `artifacts.toml`, kit registrations from `core.toml`).

At the bottom is the **Kit layer**. The **Kit Manager** handles kit installation from GitHub repositories, registration (with source and version tracking), file-level diff updates, kit config relocation, and layout migration. Each kit is an independently installable file package. Cypilot core bundles no kits — during `cpt init`, the user is prompted to install the SDLC kit (`cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`) with `[a]ccept / [d]ecline`. A plugin system for custom hooks and CLI subcommands is planned for p2.

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### Determinism First

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-determinism-first`

Everything that can be validated, checked, or enforced without an LLM MUST be handled by deterministic scripts. The LLM is reserved only for tasks requiring reasoning, creativity, or natural language understanding. This ensures reproducible results: same input → same output, regardless of which AI agent runs the command.

#### Kit-Centric

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-kit-centric`

All domain-specific value is delivered by kits. Kits are file packages containing rules, templates, checklists, examples, constraints, and workflows. Core provides infrastructure (ID system, workflows, config, agent integration, Kit Manager); kits provide the content and semantics. This separation ensures that new domains can be supported by adding a new kit as a directory of ready-to-use files.

#### Traceability by Design

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-traceability-by-design`

All design elements use structured `cpt-*` IDs following the format `cpt-{system}-{kind}-{slug}`. Code tags (`@cpt-*`) link implementation to design. Cross-references between artifacts are validated deterministically. The ID system is the backbone of Cypilot's value proposition — it enables automated verification that code implements what was designed.

#### Plugin Extensibility

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-plugin-extensibility`

Kits are file packages that provide artifact definitions (rules, templates, checklists, examples, constraints, workflows). Core does not interpret kit-specific semantics — it only knows that a kit is registered and where its files live. User customizations to kit files are preserved across updates through file-level diff — all changed files are presented as unified diffs with interactive accept/decline/modify prompts. Generated resources in the kit's config directory are also user-editable with interactive diff on regeneration. A plugin system for custom markers and hooks is planned for p2.

#### Machine-Readable Output

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-machine-readable`

All CLI commands output JSON to stdout. Config files use TOML with deterministic serialization. Validation results include file paths and line numbers. This enables programmatic consumption by CI pipelines, IDE plugins, and agent workflows without parsing human-readable text.

#### Tool-Managed Config

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-tool-managed-config`

Config files are edited exclusively by the tool, never manually. All changes go through CLI commands that validate against schemas before writing. This prevents configuration drift, ensures schema compliance, and enables reliable migration between versions.

#### Skill-Documented

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-skill-documented`

All tool capabilities MUST be fully documented in the agent-facing SKILL.md. SKILL.md is the single entry point for AI agents — it enumerates all commands, workflows, and integration points so agents can discover and use the tool's full functionality without external documentation.

#### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-dry`

Every piece of knowledge — a template, a rule, a checklist criterion, a config schema — MUST have exactly one authoritative source. Kits generate resources from a single definition; agent entry points are generated from one template per agent; validation rules live in constraints.toml, not duplicated across code. If something needs to change, it changes in one place.

#### Occam's Razor

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-occams-razor`

The simplest solution that satisfies the requirements is the correct one. No abstraction layers, extension points, or generalization beyond what is needed today. Prefer flat structures over nested, single-pass algorithms over multi-phase, plain functions over class hierarchies. Complexity must be justified by a concrete requirement, not by speculative future needs.

#### CI & Automation First, LLM Last Resort

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-ci-automation-first`

Every check, validation, and enforcement MUST be implementable as a deterministic CI step. LLM-based analysis is used only when deterministic methods are provably insufficient (e.g., semantic quality review, natural language understanding). If a task can be expressed as a regex, a schema check, or a graph traversal — it MUST NOT require an LLM. This ensures that quality gates are reproducible, fast, and free of hallucination risk.

#### Zero Harm, Only Benefits

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-zero-harm`

Adopting Cypilot MUST NOT impose costs on the development workflow. No mandatory file renames, no forced directory structures outside the Cypilot install directory and `config/`, no blocking CI gates by default, no slowdowns to existing processes. Every feature is opt-in and additive. If a team removes Cypilot, their project continues to work exactly as before — only the `{cypilot_path}/` directory and generated agent files are left behind.

#### No Manual Maintenance

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-principle-no-manual-maintenance`

Nothing that can be automated MUST require manual upkeep. Agent entry points are regenerated on `update`. Kit files are updated via file-level diff. Config migrations run automatically. Shell completions are generated from command definitions. If a human must remember to update something after a version change, that is a bug in the tool.

### 2.2 Constraints

#### Python Standard Library Only

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-constraint-python-stdlib`

Core skill engine uses Python 3.11+ standard library only (requires `tomllib` from stdlib). No third-party dependencies in core. This ensures the tool works in any Python 3.11+ environment without dependency conflicts. Kits may declare their own dependencies, managed separately. See `cpt-cypilot-adr-python-stdlib-only` for decision rationale.

#### Markdown as Contract

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-constraint-markdown-contract`

Artifacts are Markdown files with structured `cpt-*` IDs. Markdown is the contract format between humans, agents, and the tool. Workflows, templates, checklists, and rules are all Markdown. This leverages the universal readability of Markdown while enabling deterministic parsing of structured elements. See `cpt-cypilot-adr-markdown-contract` for decision rationale.

#### Git Project Heuristics

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-constraint-git-project-heuristics`

Git is the primary project detection mechanism (`.git` directory provides project root detection and version control integration). Non-Git projects are supported but without Git-based heuristics — the tool falls back to the current working directory as project root.

#### Cross-Platform Native Support

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-constraint-cross-platform`

CLI proxy and skill engine must work natively on Linux, Windows, and macOS without platform-specific workarounds or conditional dependencies. File paths use `pathlib`, subprocess calls avoid shell-specific syntax, and no OS-specific system calls are used. This constraint applies to all core components and kits.

#### No Weakening of Rules

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-constraint-no-weakening`

Validation rules cannot be bypassed or weakened in STRICT mode. The deterministic gate must pass before semantic review proceeds. This constraint ensures that the quality floor is maintained — agents cannot skip validation steps or downgrade severity of issues.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

**Technology**: Python dataclasses, TOML

**Location**: In-memory models built from filesystem state (no persistent database)

**Machine-Readable Schemas**:
- **Config schema**: `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` structure defined by [core-config.schema.json]({cypilot_path}/.core/schemas/core-config.schema.json)
- **Kit constraints schema**: [kit-constraints.schema.json]({cypilot_path}/.core/schemas/kit-constraints.schema.json)
- **Artifact registry**: [artifacts.toml]({cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml) — system, autodetect, and codebase definitions
- **Python types**: `skills/cypilot/scripts/cypilot/` — dataclass definitions for in-memory models

**Specifications** (see [specs/](./specs/) for full documents):
- **CLI**: [cli.md](./specs/cli.md) — complete CLI interface specification
- **Kit specification**: [kit/](./specs/kit/) — kit structure, file package format, constraint semantics, validation
  - [kit.md](./specs/kit/kit.md) — kit overview, directory structure, taxonomy, extension protocol

- **Artifacts registry**: [artifacts-registry.md](./specs/artifacts-registry.md) — artifacts.toml structure and agent operations
- **System prompts**: [sysprompts.md](./specs/sysprompts.md) — `{cypilot_path}/config/sysprompts/` and `config/AGENTS.md` format
- **Workspace**: core architecture in [DESIGN.md §1.2](#multi-repo-workspace-federation); implementation details in [features/workspace.md](./features/workspace.md) — workspace config, source resolution, algorithms (`resolve-git-url`, `resolve-adapter-context`, `determine-target`, `infer-role`)

**Core Entities**:

| Entity | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| System | A named project or subsystem with slug, kit assignment, and autodetect rules | `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` → systems[] |
| Artifact | A Markdown file of a specific kind (PRD, DESIGN, ADR, etc.) belonging to a system | Filesystem, registered via autodetect |
| Kit | A file package with artifact definitions (rules, templates, checklists, examples, constraints, workflows); all files in kit config directory | `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` → kits{}, `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/` |
| Identifier | A `cpt-*` ID with kind, slug, definition location (file + line), and references | Scanned from artifact Markdown |
| Config | Structured TOML in `config/` directory — core.toml + per-kit configs | Filesystem |
| AgentEntryPoint | Generated file in an agent's native format (workflow proxy, skill shim, or rule file) | Generated into `.windsurf/`, `.cursor/`, etc. |
| Blueprint | DEPRECATED per `cpt-cypilot-adr-remove-blueprint-system` — removed from architecture. Kit resources are now maintained as direct files. | N/A |
| Constraint | Kit-wide rules for ID kinds, headings, and cross-artifact references | `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/constraints.toml` |
| Workflow | A Markdown file with frontmatter, phases, and validation criteria | `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/` |
| Manifest | Optional declarative installation config (`manifest.toml`) declaring kit resources, their identifiers, default paths, types, and user-modifiability flags. Governs installation and update when present; absent → legacy copy behavior | Kit source root `manifest.toml`, validated against `kit-manifest.schema.json` |
| ResourceBinding | A resolved mapping from a manifest resource identifier to its actual filesystem path in the project. Stored in `core.toml` under `[kits.{slug}.resources]` | `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` → kits.{slug}.resources |
| WorkspaceConfig | Parsed workspace configuration with version, sources, traceability settings, and optional git URL resolve config. Can be standalone (`.cypilot-workspace.toml`) or inline (`config/core.toml` `[workspace]`) | `.cypilot-workspace.toml` or `config/core.toml` |
| SourceEntry | A named source repo in the workspace with path, role (`artifacts`/`codebase`/`kits`/`full`), optional adapter, and optional Git URL + branch | `WorkspaceConfig.sources{}` |
| TraceabilityConfig | Workspace-level traceability settings: `cross_repo` and `resolve_remote_ids` booleans controlling cross-repo ID resolution | `WorkspaceConfig.traceability` |
| ResolveConfig | Workspace-level git URL resolution settings: workdir path and namespace rules for mapping hosts to local directory templates | `WorkspaceConfig.resolve` |
| NamespaceRule | Maps a Git host (e.g. `gitlab.com`) to a local directory template (e.g. `{org}/{repo}`) for deterministic worktree placement | `ResolveConfig.namespace[]` |
| SourceContext | Runtime context for a single workspace source: resolved path, adapter dir, loaded metadata, kits, reachability status | Built by context loader from `SourceEntry` |
| WorkspaceContext | Multi-repo workspace runtime context wrapping a primary `CypilotContext` and remote `SourceContext` entries with traceability flags | Built by context loader when workspace config is found |

**Relationships**:
- System → Kit: each system is assigned to exactly one kit (by slug)
- System → Artifact[]: a system contains zero or more artifacts, discovered via autodetect rules
- System → Codebase[]: a system tracks zero or more codebase directories
- Kit → Files: each kit owns its files in its config directory (default: `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/`, relocatable)
- Kit → Artifact Resources: each kit has per-artifact resource files (rules.md, template.md, checklist.md, examples/) for each artifact kind it defines
- Kit → Constraints: kit-wide `constraints.toml` defines allowed/required ID kinds per artifact kind
- Kit → SKILL extension: kit `SKILL.md` composes into the main SKILL.md
- Kit → Manifest: a kit MAY have one `manifest.toml` manifest (0..1). If present, it declares all resources and governs installation
- Kit → ResourceBinding[]: a manifest-driven kit has zero or more resolved resource bindings stored in `core.toml` under `[kits.{slug}.resources]`. Each binding maps a resource identifier to a filesystem path
- Artifact → Identifier[]: each artifact contains zero or more ID definitions and references
- Identifier → Identifier: cross-references between definitions and references across artifacts
- Constraint → Identifier: constraints define which ID kinds are allowed/required per artifact kind
- WorkspaceConfig → SourceEntry[]: a workspace contains one or more named sources
- WorkspaceConfig → TraceabilityConfig: workspace has one traceability settings object
- WorkspaceConfig → ResolveConfig: workspace optionally has git URL resolution config
- ResolveConfig → NamespaceRule[]: resolve config contains zero or more host-to-template mappings
- WorkspaceContext → CypilotContext: workspace wraps one primary context (the current repo)
- WorkspaceContext → SourceContext[]: every SourceEntry produces a SourceContext; unreachable sources have `reachable=false` and `path=None` (never omitted)
- SourceContext → CypilotContext: each reachable source lazily resolves its own adapter context; unreachable sources skip adapter resolution

#### CLI Proxy

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-cli-proxy`

##### Why this component exists

Provides a stable global entry point (`cypilot`/`cpt`) that works both inside and outside projects. Manages the skill bundle cache so users don't need to manually download or update the tool.

##### Responsibility scope

- Maintain local skill bundle cache (`~/.cypilot/cache/`)
- Route commands to project-installed skill (if inside a project) or cached skill (if outside)
- Perform non-blocking background version checks
- Display version update notices when cached version is newer than project version

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT contain any skill logic, workflow logic, or command implementations. Does NOT interpret command arguments — passes them through to the resolved skill. Does NOT modify project files.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — proxies all commands to this component

#### Skill Engine

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine`

##### Why this component exists

Central command dispatcher that provides a uniform interface for all Cypilot functionality. Ensures all commands follow the same conventions (JSON output, exit codes, deterministic behavior).

##### Responsibility scope

- Parse and route CLI commands to appropriate handlers
- Enforce JSON output format for all commands
- Manage exit code conventions (0=PASS, 1=error, 2=FAIL)
- Load and expose SKILL.md as the agent entry point
- Register kit commands at runtime (p2: kit plugin CLI subcommands)

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT execute workflows (workflows are interpreted by AI agents). Does NOT contain domain-specific validation logic (delegated to kits). Does NOT manage config schema — delegates to Config Manager.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-cli-proxy` — receives commands from proxy
- `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` — delegates validation commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-traceability-engine` — delegates ID query commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — delegates config commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager` — manages kit lifecycle
- `cpt-cypilot-component-agent-generator` — delegates agent commands

#### Validator

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-validator`

##### Why this component exists

Provides the deterministic quality gate that ensures artifacts meet structural requirements without relying on an LLM. This is the core of Cypilot's value — catching issues that agents miss or hallucinate.

##### Responsibility scope

- Template structure compliance checking (heading patterns, required sections)
- ID format validation (`cpt-{system}-{kind}-{slug}` pattern)
- Priority marker validation
- Placeholder detection (TODO, TBD, FIXME)
- Cross-reference validation (covered_by, checked consistency)
- Constraint enforcement from `constraints.toml` (headings scoping, reference rules). For manifest-driven kits, the path to `constraints.toml` is resolved from the kit's resource bindings in `core.toml`
- Kit structural validation (`validate-kits`): verify kit directory exists with required files. For manifest-driven kits, resolves paths to constraints, templates, and examples from resource bindings in `core.toml` instead of assuming the default kit directory structure
- TOC validation (`validate-toc`): verify anchors resolve, all headings covered, TOC not stale
- Stable error codes (`error_codes.py`): machine-readable codes for all validation issues, used by fixing prompts and downstream consumers
- Fixing prompt generation (`fixing.py`): enrich errors with actionable prompts for LLM agents
- Single-pass scanning for performance (≤ 3s per artifact)

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT perform semantic validation (checklist review is done by AI agents). Does NOT modify artifacts — read-only analysis. Does NOT validate code files directly.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives validation commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-traceability-engine` — uses ID scanning results
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — reads config for system/artifact resolution; reads resource bindings for manifest-driven kit path resolution
- Installed kits may register validation hooks via constraints.toml

#### Traceability Engine

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-traceability-engine`

##### Why this component exists

Implements the ID system that links design elements to code. Without this component, there is no automated way to verify that code implements what was designed.

##### Responsibility scope

- Scan artifacts for ID definitions (`**ID**: \`cpt-...\``) and references (backticked `cpt-...`)
- Scan code for traceability tags (`@cpt-*`) with language-aware comment detection (`language_config.py`)
- Resolve cross-references between definitions and references
- Provide query commands: `list-ids`, `list-id-kinds`, `where-defined`, `where-used`, `get-content`
- Support ID versioning (`-vN` suffix)
- Markdown structure parsing (`parsing.py`): section extraction, heading analysis, content block identification
- Spec coverage analysis: measure CDSL marker coverage percentage and instruction granularity per code file

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT define which ID kinds are valid — that comes from kit constraints. Does NOT enforce cross-artifact reference rules — that's the Validator's job (using data from this engine). Does NOT modify files.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` — provides ID scan data for validation
- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives query commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — reads config for system/artifact resolution

#### Config Manager

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager`

##### Why this component exists

Ensures config integrity by centralizing all config file operations behind schema validation. Prevents configuration drift and enables reliable migration between versions.

##### Responsibility scope

- CRUD operations on `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` (system definitions, kit registrations, ignore lists, resource bindings)
- Resource binding management: read/write `[kits.{slug}.resources]` section in `core.toml` — stores resolved resource identifier → path mappings for manifest-driven kits. Provides a lookup API so other components (Skill Engine, workflows) can resolve `{identifier}` template variables to filesystem paths
- Schema validation before any write operation (including resource bindings validated against `core-config.schema.json`)
- Deterministic TOML serialization
- Config migration between versions (with backup before migration)
- JSON → TOML format migration (`migrate-config` command): detect legacy `.json` files, convert to `.toml`, validate, remove originals
- Backward-compatible config loading: read `.toml` first, fall back to `.json` with deprecation warning
- Provide CLI commands for config inspection (`config show`)

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT manage kit file content. Does NOT interpret kit-specific semantics.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives config commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager` — coordinates kit config creation during installation
- `cpt-cypilot-component-validator` — provides config data for validation context

#### Kit Manager

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager`

##### Why this component exists

Manages the kit lifecycle — installing, registering, and updating kits. Enables the extensible architecture where new domains can be added by providing a new kit as a directory of ready-to-use files.

##### Responsibility scope

- Kit installation from GitHub: download kit from GitHub repository (`cpt kit install --github <owner/repo>`), copy all kit files from source into `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}/`, register in `core.toml` with GitHub source and version, regenerate `.gen/AGENTS.md` and `.gen/SKILL.md` to include the new kit's navigation and skill routing. All files in the kit's config directory are user-editable and preserved across updates via interactive diff
- Manifest-driven installation (see `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-kit-manifest`): if the kit source contains `manifest.toml`, the Kit Manager validates it against `kit-manifest.schema.json`, reads all declared resources, prompts the user for destination paths on `user_modifiable` resources (offering defaults), copies each resource to its resolved path, resolves template variables (`{identifier}`) in kit files, and registers all resolved paths in `core.toml` under `[kits.{slug}.resources]`. If no `manifest.toml` is present, falls back to the current behavior (copy predefined content directories and files). The kit root directory itself (`{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}`) may be relocated by the user during manifest-driven installation if the manifest declares `user_modifiable = true`
- Kit registration: add kit entry to `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` with config output path, GitHub source (`github:<owner>/<repo>`), version (GitHub tag), and resolved resource paths (`resources` map)
- Version tracking: store kit version in `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/{slug}/conf.toml`; kit source and version also tracked in `core.toml`
- Update modes: force (`--force`) overwrites all kit files; interactive (default) uses file-level diff — compares each file in the new version against user's installed copy, shows unified diffs, prompts with accept/decline/accept-all/decline-all/modify via Resource Diff Engine. For manifest-driven kits, updates apply diffs to the registered resource paths (not just the kit directory), detect new resources in the updated manifest (prompt user for path and register), and warn about resources removed from the manifest (preserve existing paths in `core.toml`). When updating a legacy-installed kit (no `resources` section in `core.toml`) and the new version introduces a manifest, auto-populate all resource bindings from existing kit root + manifest defaults before applying diffs
- Resource path exposure: resolved resource variables are returned by `cpt info` as part of kit information, enabling agents and scripts to discover resource locations programmatically
- Kit config relocation: `cpt kit move-config <slug>` moves the kit's config directory to a new location, updates `core.toml` (including all resource paths that are relative to the kit root)
- Layout restructuring: detect old directory layout and automatically restructure (move generated outputs from `.gen/kits/` to `config/kits/`, clean up `.gen/kits/`)
- Kit structural validation (`validate-kits` command): verify kit directory exists with required files (`conf.toml`, `constraints.toml`, `artifacts/` directory); for manifest-driven kits, additionally verify all registered resource paths exist on disk
- Plugin loading (p2): discover and load kit Python entry points at runtime

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT own kit resource content — kit files are maintained directly. Does NOT perform kit-specific validation beyond structural checks. Does NOT interpret resource content — only manages resource placement and path registration.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives kit management commands
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — updates core.toml during kit registration
- Installed kits (e.g., SDLC kit from `cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`) — managed by this component

#### Agent Generator

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-component-agent-generator`

##### Why this component exists

Bridges the gap between Cypilot's unified skill system and the diverse file format requirements of different AI coding assistants. Without this component, users would need to manually create and maintain agent-specific files.

##### Responsibility scope

- Generate workflow entry points in each agent's native format from kit workflow files (e.g., `.windsurf/workflows/cypilot-{name}.md` → `config/kits/<slug>/workflows/{name}.md`)
- Compose SKILL.md: collect kit SKILL.md extensions and assemble them into the main SKILL.md alongside core commands
- Generate skill shims that reference the composed SKILL.md
- Support 5 agents: Windsurf (`.windsurf/workflows/`), Cursor (`.cursor/rules/`), Claude (`.claude/commands/`), Copilot (`.github/prompts/`), OpenAI
- Full overwrite on each invocation (no merge with existing files)
- Support `--agent` flag for single-agent regeneration

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT maintain agent-specific state. Does NOT define SKILL extension content — collects from kit files. Does NOT persist agent selection in config.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cypilot-component-skill-engine` — receives `agents` command
- `cpt-cypilot-component-kit-manager` — provides kit SKILL.md extensions for composition
- `cpt-cypilot-component-config-manager` — reads config for project context

#### External Kits

The following kits are external packages that can be installed and managed by the Kit Manager:

* SDLC Kit (`cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`): provides SDLC-specific workflows and validation rules

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-interface-github-gh-cli`

**Direction**: required from client
**Protocol/Format**: GitHub REST/GraphQL API accessed through `gh` CLI v2.0+
**Used by**: SDLC Kit (PR review/status workflows)

### 3.4 Internal Dependencies

No internal module dependencies beyond the component relationships documented in Section 3.2. All components are part of a single Python package and communicate through direct function calls within the same process.

**Dependency Rules**:
- Components access each other through well-defined interfaces (not internal implementation details)
- Validator and Traceability Engine share scan results through a common data model (ID definitions, references)
- Kit plugins register hooks at startup — core components invoke hooks through a registry, not direct imports
- No circular dependencies: core components do not depend on kit plugins; plugins depend on core interfaces

### 3.5 External Dependencies

#### GitHub API (via `gh` CLI)

| Dependency | Interface Used | Purpose |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| `gh` CLI v2.0+ | CLI subprocess invocation | Fetch PR diffs, metadata, comments, and status for SDLC kit PR review/status workflows |

**Dependency Rules**:
- `gh` CLI is optional — only required for PR review/status workflows
- `cpt doctor` checks `gh` availability and authentication status
- PR workflows fail gracefully with actionable error message if `gh` is not available

#### Python Runtime

| Dependency | Interface Used | Purpose |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| Python 3.11+ | Runtime environment | Execute all Cypilot skill scripts and kit plugins (requires `tomllib` from stdlib) |

**Dependency Rules**:
- Core uses stdlib only — no pip dependencies
- `cpt doctor` checks Python version compatibility

#### pipx (recommended)

| Dependency | Interface Used | Purpose |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| pipx | Package installer | Global CLI proxy installation in isolated environment |

**Dependency Rules**:
- pipx is recommended but not required — manual installation is possible
- `cpt doctor` checks pipx availability

            Skill Engine-->>User: "Cypilot initialized. Install kits later: cpt kit install --github <owner/repo>"
        end
    end
```

**Description**: User initializes Cypilot in a project. The skill engine asks for install directory and agent selection. It defines a **root system** (name and slug derived from the project directory name), creates core configs (`core.toml` with root system, `artifacts.toml` with default autodetect rules), generates agent entry points, and sets up `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md` with default WHEN rules. After core setup, the tool prompts `Install SDLC kit? [a]ccept [d]ecline`. If accepted, the kit is downloaded from GitHub. If the kit source contains `manifest.toml`, the Kit Manager validates the manifest, reads declared resources, prompts the user for destination paths on `user_modifiable` resources, copies each resource to its resolved path, resolves template variables in kit files, and registers all resource bindings in `core.toml`. If no `manifest.toml` is present, files are copied to the default kit config directory. If declined, the user can install kits later via `cpt kit install`.

**Root AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md injection**: During initialization (and verified on every CLI invocation), the engine ensures the project root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files contain the same managed block with only the configured adapter path:

````markdown
<!-- @cpt:root-agents -->
```toml
cypilot_path = ".bootstrap"
```
<!-- @/cpt:root-agents -->
````

The block is inserted at the **beginning** of each file. If a file does not exist, it is created. The managed content is a TOML fence that declares only `cypilot_path`, and the path reflects the actual install directory. Content between the `<!-- @cpt:root-agents -->` and `<!-- @/cpt:root-agents -->` comment markers is fully managed by Cypilot — it is overwritten on every check, so manual edits inside the block are discarded.

**Integrity invariant**: every Cypilot CLI command (not just `init`) verifies the root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` blocks exist and are correct before proceeding. If a block is missing or the path is stale (e.g., install directory changed), the engine silently re-injects it. This guarantees that root agent files always expose the current `cypilot_path` without duplicating navigation rules.

#### Artifact Validation

        Validator-->>Skill Engine: {status: FAIL, errors, warnings}
        Skill Engine-->>User: JSON report with errors + fixing prompts (exit code 2)
    end
```

**Description**: Single artifact validation flow. The validator performs a single-pass scan, using the traceability engine for ID resolution, and returns a structured JSON report with PASS/FAIL status.

#### Agent Workflow Execution (Generate)

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-generate-workflow`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-create-artifact`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

```mermaid

    AI Agent->>Skill Engine: validate --artifact <path>
    Skill Engine-->>AI Agent: validation result
    AI Agent-->>User: "✓ Written + Validated"
```

**Description**: Artifact generation is orchestrated by the AI agent, not the tool. The agent reads workflows and rules as instructions, collects information from the user, generates content, writes files, and invokes deterministic validation.

#### PR Review

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-pr-review`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-pr-review`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

            AI Agent->>AI Agent: write review report
            AI Agent-->>User: summary with findings
        end
    end
```

**Description**: PR review is driven by the AI agent using `gh` CLI for data fetching. The tool provides configurable prompts and checklists; the agent performs the analysis and writes a structured report.

#### Version Update

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-update`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-update`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>CLI Proxy: cpt update
    CLI Proxy->>CLI Proxy: refresh cache if needed
    CLI Proxy->>Skill Engine: update command
    Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: copy cached skill to project
    Skill Engine->>Kit Manager: detect directory layout version
    alt old layout detected
        Kit Manager->>Kit Manager: backup + restructure layout
        Kit Manager->>Kit Manager: move .gen/kits/→config/kits/

    Skill Engine->>Agent Generator: regenerate entry points
    Skill Engine-->>User: "Updated to {version}. Run 'cpt kit update' for kit updates."
```

**Description**: Update copies the cached skill into the project, detects directory layout (triggering automatic restructuring if old layout detected), migrates config files (with backup), migrates bundled kit references to GitHub sources (for projects upgrading from versions < 3.0.8), and regenerates agent entry points for compatibility. Kit file updates are a separate operation via `cpt kit update`.

#### ID Resolution Query

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-traceability-query`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-validate`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

    Traceability Engine-->>Skill Engine: {file, line, content}
    Skill Engine-->>User: JSON {defined_in: "architecture/PRD.md:154"}
```

**Description**: ID resolution query scans all registered artifacts to find where an ID is defined. Used by agents for navigation and by the validator for cross-reference checking.

#### Workspace Initialization

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-workspace-init`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-workspace-init`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

            Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: recurse into subdirectory
        end
    end
    Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: check for existing workspace config conflicts
    alt conflict found and no --force

    else write config
        alt --inline
            Skill Engine->>Config Manager: write [workspace] to config/core.toml
        else standalone
            Skill Engine->>Config Manager: write .cypilot-workspace.toml
        end
        Skill Engine-->>User: JSON {status: OK, config_path, sources_count}
    end
```

**Description**: Workspace initialization scans the project tree for nested repositories, infers source roles from directory structure, and writes a workspace configuration file. The `--inline` flag controls whether config is embedded in `core.toml` or written as a standalone file. The `--max-depth` flag limits recursion depth (default 3). Symlinks are skipped during scanning. Role inference (`cpt-cypilot-algo-workspace-infer-role`) checks for source directories (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `pkg/`), documentation directories (`docs/`, `architecture/`, `requirements/`), and a `kits/` directory — repos with multiple capability types get role `full`; single-capability repos get the matching role; repos with no recognized directories default to `full`.

#### Add Workspace Source

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-workspace-add`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-workspace-add`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>CLI Proxy: cpt workspace-add --name <name> --path <path>|--url <url> [--force]
    CLI Proxy->>Skill Engine: workspace-add command
    Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: find project root
    Skill Engine->>Config Manager: locate workspace config (inline or standalone)
    alt no workspace found
        Skill Engine-->>User: ERROR "no workspace config, run workspace-init"
    else workspace found
        Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: check if source name already exists
        alt collision and no --force
            Skill Engine-->>User: ERROR "source already exists, use --force"
        else add source
            Skill Engine->>Config Manager: add/replace source entry
            Config Manager->>Config Manager: write updated workspace config
            Skill Engine-->>User: JSON {status: OK, action: added|replaced}
        end
    end
```

**Description**: Adds a local path or Git URL source to an existing workspace configuration. The command auto-detects whether the workspace uses inline or standalone config. Source name collisions require the `--force` flag to replace.

#### Workspace Info

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-workspace-info`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-workspace-info`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

                end
            else unreachable
                Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: add warning
            end
        end
        Skill Engine-->>User: JSON {version, config_path, sources[], traceability}
    end
```

**Description**: Reports workspace health by resolving each source path, checking reachability, probing for adapters, and loading artifact metadata. Returns a comprehensive status including per-source info (reachability, adapter presence, artifact counts) and workspace-level traceability settings.

#### Workspace Sync

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-seq-workspace-sync`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-workspace-sync`

**Actors**: `cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>CLI Proxy: cpt workspace-sync [--source <name>] [--force] [--dry-run]
    CLI Proxy->>Skill Engine: workspace-sync command
    Skill Engine->>Skill Engine: find project root

    else sync sources
        loop each Git source
            Skill Engine->>Git: sync_git_source(url, branch, base_dir)
            alt sync success
                Git-->>Skill Engine: synced
            else sync failure
                Git-->>Skill Engine: error details
            end
        end
        alt any synced
            Skill Engine-->>User: JSON {status: OK, synced, failed}
        else all failed
            Skill Engine-->>User: JSON {status: FAIL, failed} (exit code 2)
        end
    end
```

**Description**: Fetches and updates Git URL workspace sources. Each source is synced via `cpt-cypilot-algo-workspace-sync-git-source`. Only sources with a configured URL are eligible for sync. The `--source` flag targets a single source. The command reports per-source sync results and fails (exit code 2) only if all sources fail.

### 3.7 Database schemas & tables

Not applicable — Cypilot does not use a database. All persistent state is stored in the filesystem:

- **`{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml`** — core config (system definitions, kit registrations with config paths and resolved resource bindings, ignore lists). For manifest-driven kits, the `[kits.{slug}.resources]` section stores identifier → path mappings (e.g., `adr_artifacts = "architecture/ADR"`)
- **`{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml`** — artifact registry (systems, artifacts, codebases)
- **`{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/`** — per-kit files (conf.toml, SKILL.md, constraints.toml, artifacts/, codebase/, workflows/, scripts/) — all user-editable, path configurable per kit, preserved via interactive diff on update
- **`{cypilot_path}/.gen/`** — top-level auto-generated files only (AGENTS.md, SKILL.md, README.md)
- **`~/.cypilot/cache/`** — global skill bundle cache
- **Markdown artifacts** — source of truth for design (PRD.md, DESIGN.md, etc.)

## 4. Additional context

### Performance Considerations

The validator uses single-pass scanning to meet the ≤ 3 second requirement. Artifacts are read once into memory, and all checks (template structure, ID format, constraints, cross-references) are performed in a single traversal. No external calls (network, database, LLM) are made during validation.

### Extensibility Model

The kit plugin system is designed for extension at four levels:

1. **Kit-level**: New kits can be created for entirely new domains (e.g., API design, infrastructure-as-code). Each kit is a self-contained package installable from GitHub.
2. **Artifact-level**: Within a kit, new artifact kinds can be added via config. Kits may support adding custom artifact types through plugin CLI commands.
3. **Resource-level**: Within an artifact kind, users can override templates, extend checklists, modify rules, and embed custom prompts. Overrides are preserved across updates.
4. **Placement-level**: Kits with a declarative manifest (`manifest.toml`) allow users to customize where each resource is placed in the project during installation. Resource identifiers become template variables resolvable by workflows and the execution protocol, enabling kit resources to be scattered across the project tree (not just under the kit config directory).

### Migration Strategy

Config migration follows a forward-only strategy:
1. Each version of `core.toml` has a schema version field
2. Migration scripts transform config from version N to N+1
3. Kit plugins provide their own migration scripts
4. Before any migration, a backup is created
5. If migration fails, the backup is restored and the user is notified

#### Directory Layout Restructuring

The new layout consolidates all kit files into `config/kits/`, removes reference copies (replaced by file-level diff), and moves generated outputs from `.gen/kits/` to `config/kits/`. This is an internal v3 restructuring that runs automatically during `cpt update`. The Layout Migrator (part of Kit Manager) performs this:

| Source (old) | Destination (new) | Action |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| `.gen/kits/{slug}/` | `config/kits/{slug}/` | Move (generated outputs) |
| `kits/{slug}/` (reference copies) | — | Remove (replaced by file-level diff) |
| `.gen/kits/` | — | Remove directory (top-level `.gen/` files preserved) |

**Detection**: Old layout is detected when `{cypilot_path}/.gen/kits/{slug}/` exists.

**Triggers**: Automatically during `cpt update` when old layout is detected.

#### JSON → TOML Format Migration

All configuration and constraint files are migrating from JSON to TOML:

| File (old) | File (new) | Owner |
|------------|------------|-------|
| `config/core.json` | `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` | Config Manager |
| `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/*.json` | `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/*.toml` | Kit plugins |
| `constraints.json` | `constraints.toml` | Kit Manager |
| `.cypilot-adapter/artifacts.toml` | `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml` | Config Manager |

**Rationale**: TOML is human-readable, supports comments, and is used consistently for all Cypilot configuration files. JSON remains the CLI output format (stdout).

**Migrator** (`cpt migrate-config`):
1. Detect existing `.json` config files in `config/` and `.cypilot-adapter/`
   - `.cypilot-adapter/artifacts.toml` migrates to `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml` (new location)
2. For each file: parse JSON → serialize as TOML → write `.toml` alongside `.json`
3. Validate the new `.toml` file against the schema
4. If validation passes: remove the `.json` file
5. If validation fails: keep `.json`, report error, skip that file
6. `constraints.toml` is a kit file — updated via file-level diff during kit update
7. The migrator runs automatically during `cpt update` when upgrading from a JSON-based version
8. Manual trigger: `cpt migrate-config` for explicit migration

**Backward compatibility**: the Config Manager reads `.toml` first; if not found, falls back to `.json` and emits a deprecation warning suggesting `cpt migrate-config`.

### Testing Approach

Component-level tests use fixture artifacts (synthetic Markdown files and TOML configs in `tests/fixtures/`). Mock boundaries:

- **Validator tests**: use fixture artifacts with known structural issues; no filesystem mocking needed (real temp files)
- **Traceability Engine tests**: use fixture artifacts with known ID patterns; verify scan results against expected definitions/references
- **Config Manager tests**: use temporary config directories; verify schema validation, serialization determinism, and migration correctness
- **CLI integration tests**: invoke the skill engine as a subprocess with fixture projects; verify JSON output and exit codes
- **Kit plugin tests**: use fixture kit directories; verify resource generation, CLI subcommand registration, and migration scripts
- **PR review tests**: mock `gh` CLI subprocess calls; verify prompt loading and report structure

Test data strategy: all test fixtures are self-contained in `tests/` — no dependency on the live `architecture/` or `config/` directories. Tests verify determinism by running the same input twice and asserting identical output.

### Non-Applicable Design Domains

The following design domains are not applicable to Cypilot and are explicitly excluded:

- **Security Architecture** (SEC): Cypilot is a local CLI tool with no authentication, authorization, or data protection requirements. It does not handle user credentials, PII, or network security. The only security consideration (no secrets in config, no untrusted code execution) is addressed in the NFR allocation.
- **Performance Architecture** (PERF): Cypilot processes single repositories locally with single-pass in-memory scanning. There is no caching strategy, database access optimization, or scalability architecture needed. The ≤ 3s validation target is met by design (single-pass, stdlib-only, no external calls).
- **Reliability Architecture** (REL): Cypilot runs as a local CLI tool, not a service. There are no fault tolerance, redundancy, or disaster recovery requirements. Config migration with backup addresses the only recoverability concern.
- **Data Architecture** (DATA): No database. All state is in the filesystem (Markdown + TOML). No data partitioning, replication, sharding, or archival needed.
- **Integration Architecture** (INT): The only external integration is `gh` CLI for PR review, which is a simple subprocess call with graceful failure handling. No integration middleware, event architecture, or API gateway needed.
- **Operations Architecture** (OPS): Installed locally via pipx. No deployment topology, container orchestration, observability infrastructure, or monitoring needed.
- **Compliance Architecture** (COMPL): No regulated data, no compliance certifications, no privacy architecture needed.
- **Usability Architecture** (UX): CLI tool with no frontend. No state management, responsive design, or progressive enhancement needed.
