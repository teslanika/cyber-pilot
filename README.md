## Cyber Pilot — Deterministic Agent Tool for Structured Workflows

Cypilot is a **deterministic agent tool** that embeds into AI coding assistants and CI pipelines to provide structured workflows, artifact validation, and design-to-code traceability.

Everything that can be validated, checked, or enforced without an LLM is handled by **deterministic scripts**; the LLM is reserved only for tasks that require reasoning, creativity, or natural language understanding.

## Problem

- **AI Agent Non-Determinism** — AI agents produce inconsistent results without structured guardrails; deterministic validation catches structural and traceability issues that LLMs miss or hallucinate
- **Design-Code Disconnect** — code diverges from design when there is no single source of truth and no automated traceability enforcement
- **Fragmented Tool Setup** — each AI agent (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot) requires different file formats for skills, workflows, and rules; maintaining these manually is error-prone
- **Inconsistent PR Reviews** — code reviews vary in depth and focus without structured checklists and prompts
- **Manual Configuration Overhead** — project-specific conventions, artifact locations, and validation rules require manual setup and synchronization

## What Cypilot Provides

Two layers of functionality:

- **Core** — deterministic skill engine, generic workflows (generate/analyze), multi-agent integrations (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot, OpenAI), global CLI (`cypilot`/`cpt`), config directory management, extensible kit system with blueprint-based resource generation, ID/traceability infrastructure, and Cypilot DSL (CDSL) for behavioral specifications
- **SDLC Kit** — artifact-first development pipeline (PRD → DESIGN → ADR → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE) with templates, checklists, examples, deterministic validation, cross-artifact consistency checks, and GitHub PR review/status workflows

Works with any language, stack, or repository.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** — required for the CLI tool and skill engine (uses `tomllib` from stdlib)
- **Git** — for project detection and version control
- **AI Agent** — Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or OpenAI Codex
- **`gh` CLI** (optional) — required only for PR review/status workflows
- **`pipx`** (recommended) — for global CLI installation

---

## Installation

### Global CLI (recommended)

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/cyberfabric/cyber-pilot.git
```

This installs `cypilot` and `cpt` commands globally. The CLI is a thin proxy shell — on first run it downloads the skill bundle into `~/.cypilot/cache/` and delegates all commands to the cached or project-local skill engine.

---

## Project Setup

```bash
# Initialize Cypilot in your project
cpt init

# Generate agent entry points for your IDE
cpt generate-agents --agent windsurf

# Generate all agents for your IDE
cpt generate-agents
```

`cpt init` creates the Cypilot directory (default: `cypilot/`) with three subdirectories:

| Directory | Purpose | Editable? |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `.core/` | Read-only core files (skills, workflows, schemas, architecture, requirements) copied from cache | No |
| `.gen/` | Auto-generated files (SKILL.md, AGENTS.md, kit outputs, constraints) from blueprints | No |
| `config/` | User-editable config (`core.toml`, `artifacts.toml`, AGENTS.md, kit blueprints) | Yes |

The command also:
- Defines a root system (name/slug derived from the project directory)
- Creates `config/core.toml` and `config/artifacts.toml`
- Installs all available kits and generates resources from blueprints
- Injects a managed `<!-- @cpt:root-agents -->` block into the root `AGENTS.md`

Supported agents: `windsurf`, `cursor`, `claude`, `copilot`, `openai`.

## Using Cypilot

Start requests with `cypilot` in your AI agent chat. This switches the agent into Cypilot mode: it loads config and rules, routes the request to the right workflow (analyze vs generate), and gates file writes behind explicit confirmation.

```
cypilot on            — enable Cypilot mode
cypilot off           — disable Cypilot mode
cypilot auto-config   — scan project and generate convention rules
```

A full walkthrough is available in [`guides/STORY.md`](guides/STORY.md).

### Example Prompts

**Setup & Configuration**

| Prompt | What the agent does |
|--------|---------------------|
| `cypilot init` | Initializes Cypilot — creates config directory, generates rules, injects root AGENTS.md |
| `cypilot auto-config` | Scans project structure and generates per-system convention rules |
| `cypilot show config` | Displays config structure, registered artifacts, and codebase mappings |
| `cypilot generate-agents --agent windsurf` | Regenerates agent entry points for a specific agent |

**Artifact Generation**

| Prompt | What the agent does |
|--------|---------------------|
| `cypilot make PRD for user authentication system` | Generates PRD with actors, requirements, flows following the template |
| `cypilot make DESIGN from PRD.md` | Transforms PRD into architecture design with full traceability |
| `cypilot decompose auth feature into tasks` | Creates DECOMPOSITION with ordered, dependency-mapped implementation units |
| `cypilot make FEATURE for login flow` | Produces feature design with acceptance criteria, CDSL flows, edge cases |

**Validation & Quality**

| Prompt | What the agent does |
|--------|---------------------|
| `cypilot validate PRD.md` | Runs deterministic template validation + semantic quality scoring |
| `cypilot validate all` | Validates entire artifact hierarchy, checks cross-references, reports issues |
| `cypilot validate code for auth module` | Scans code for `@cpt-*` markers, verifies coverage against feature docs |
| `cypilot review DESIGN.md with consistency-checklist` | Multi-phase consistency analysis detecting contradictions |

**Traceability & Search**

| Prompt | What the agent does |
|--------|---------------------|
| `cypilot find requirements related to authentication` | Searches artifacts for IDs matching pattern, returns definitions and references |
| `cypilot trace cpt-myapp-fr-auth` | Traces requirement through DESIGN → FEATURE → code |
| `cypilot list unimplemented features` | Cross-references feature docs with code markers |

**Code Review & Pull Requests**

| Prompt | What the agent does |
|--------|---------------------|
| `cypilot review PR #123` | Fetches PR diff, analyzes against checklists, produces structured review report |
| `cypilot PR status #123` | Assesses unreplied comments by severity, audits resolved comments, reports CI status |

### Agent Skill

Cypilot provides a unified **Agent Skill** (`cypilot`) defined in `skills/cypilot/SKILL.md`. The skill is loaded into the agent's context when Cypilot mode is enabled and provides:

- Deterministic validation and traceability commands
- Protocol Guard for consistent context loading
- Workflow routing (generate vs analyze)
- ID lookup and cross-reference resolution
- Auto-configuration for brownfield projects

### Workflow Commands

Cypilot has exactly **two** universal workflows:

| Command | Workflow | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `/cypilot-generate` | `generate.md` | Write: create, edit, fix, update, implement, refactor, configure |
| `/cypilot-analyze` | `analyze.md` | Read: validate, review, check, inspect, audit, compare |

Kit-specific workflows (e.g., PR review, PR status) are generated from blueprint `@cpt:workflow` markers and exposed as agent entry points automatically.

### Checklists and Quality Gates

**Artifact checklists** (generated from SDLC kit blueprints):
- **PRD** — 300+ criteria for requirements completeness
- **DESIGN** — 380+ criteria for architecture validation
- **DECOMPOSITION** — 130+ criteria for feature breakdown quality
- **FEATURE** — 380+ criteria for implementation readiness
- **ADR** — 270+ criteria for decision rationale

**Generic checklists** in `requirements/`:
- [**Code checklist**](requirements/code-checklist.md) — 200+ criteria for code quality
- [**Consistency checklist**](requirements/consistency-checklist.md) — 45+ criteria for cross-artifact consistency
- [**Reverse engineering**](requirements/reverse-engineering.md) — 270+ criteria for legacy code analysis
- [**Prompt engineering**](requirements/prompt-engineering.md) — 220+ criteria for AI prompt design

### Update

```bash
cpt update
```

Updates `.core/` from cache, regenerates `.gen/` from user blueprints, and ensures `config/` scaffold integrity. User-editable files in `config/` are never overwritten.

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

After `cpt init`, a project has:

```
project/
├── cypilot/                    # Cypilot install directory
│   ├── .core/                  # Read-only core (from cache)
│   │   ├── skills/             # Skill engine + scripts
│   │   ├── workflows/          # Core workflows (generate.md, analyze.md)
│   │   ├── schemas/            # JSON schemas
│   │   ├── architecture/       # Core architecture docs (PRD, DESIGN, specs)
│   │   └── requirements/       # Core requirements + checklists
│   ├── .gen/                   # Auto-generated (from blueprints)
│   │   ├── AGENTS.md           # Generated WHEN rules + sysprompt content
│   │   ├── SKILL.md            # Composed skill with kit extensions
│   │   └── kits/sdlc/          # Generated artifacts, workflows, constraints
│   ├── kits/sdlc/              # Reference kit copies (from cache, read-only)
│   └── config/                 # User-editable
│       ├── core.toml           # System definitions, kit registrations
│       ├── artifacts.toml      # Artifact registry, autodetect rules
│       ├── AGENTS.md           # User WHEN rules
│       ├── SKILL.md            # User skill extensions
│       └── kits/sdlc/          # User-editable blueprints
│           └── blueprints/
├── AGENTS.md                   # Root entry (managed block → cypilot/.gen/)
├── .windsurf/                  # Agent entry points (generated)
├── .cursor/
├── .claude/
└── .github/prompts/
```

### Blueprint System

Each kit is a **blueprint package** — a `blueprints/` directory containing one `.md` file per artifact kind. Blueprints are the single source of truth from which all kit resources are generated:

| Blueprint Marker | Generated Output |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `@cpt:heading` + `@cpt:id` | `constraints.toml` (heading/ID constraints) |
| `@cpt:rules` + `@cpt:rule` | `rules.md` (validation rules) |
| `@cpt:check` | `checklist.md` (quality criteria) |
| `@cpt:prompt` | `template.md` (writing instructions) |
| `@cpt:example` | `examples/example.md` |
| `@cpt:skill` | `SKILL.md` (kit skill extensions) |
| `@cpt:system-prompt` | `AGENTS.md` (agent system prompt content) |
| `@cpt:workflow` | `workflows/{name}.md` (kit-specific workflows) |

Users can customize blueprints in `config/kits/{slug}/blueprints/`. Running `cpt update` regenerates `.gen/` from user blueprints while preserving user config.

---

## Extensibility

Cypilot is extensible through **Kits** — self-contained packages that bundle templates, rules, checklists, examples, and workflows for a specific domain. The kit plugin system supports extension at three levels:

1. **Kit-level** — new kits for entirely new domains (e.g., API design, infrastructure-as-code)
2. **Artifact-level** — new artifact kinds within an existing kit
3. **Resource-level** — override templates, extend checklists, modify rules within an artifact kind

### Kit: **Cypilot SDLC**

The built-in SDLC Kit provides an artifact-first development pipeline with end-to-end traceability:

**PRD → ADR + DESIGN → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE**

Each artifact kind has templates, rules, checklists (300+ criteria), and examples. The kit also provides PR review and PR status workflows for GitHub.

See the [SDLC Kit README](kits/sdlc/README.md) for the full pipeline overview, artifact kinds, and guides.
