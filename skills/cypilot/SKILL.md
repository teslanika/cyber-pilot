## Goal

Cypilot provides artifact validation, cross-reference validation, code traceability, spec coverage measurement, ID search/navigation, kit management, TOC generation/validation, multi-agent integration, and design-to-code implementation with `@cpt-*` markers.

## Preconditions

- `cpt` available (preferred) or `python3` as fallback
- Target paths exist and are readable

---

## ⚠️ MUST Instruction Semantics ⚠️

**MUST** and **ALWAYS** are mandatory. Skipping any MUST instruction invalidates execution, the output must be discarded, and the workflow fails.

## Agent Acknowledgment

- [ ] MUST/ALWAYS are mandatory; skipping any MUST invalidates execution.
- [ ] I will read all required files before proceeding.
- [ ] I will follow workflows step-by-step without shortcuts.
- [ ] I will not create or modify files, or execute any other write-capable Cypilot command, without explicit user confirmation, and I will not add auto-approval flags unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- [ ] I will list Cypilot files read, why, and the triggering instruction before any approval prompt.

By proceeding with Cypilot work, I acknowledge and accept these requirements.

ALWAYS SET {cypilot_mode} = `on` FIRST when loading this skill

## Execution Logging

ALWAYS provide execution visibility:
- Notify the user when entering any H2 section of a Cypilot prompt.
- Notify the user when completing any `- [ ]` checklist task.
- Use `- [CONTEXT]: MESSAGE`; set context to the file/section and message to the action + why.
- Logging must help the user understand loaded prompts, routing decisions, debugging state, and workflow progress.

Example:
```text
- [execution-protocol]: Entering "Load Rules" — target is CODE, loading codebase/rules.md
- [DESIGN rules]: Completing "Validate structure" — all required sections present
- [workflows/generate.md]: Entering "Determine Target" — user requested code implementation
```

## Variables

| Variable | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{cypilot_path}` | Directory path resolved from root `AGENTS.md` | Base path for all Cypilot-relative references |
| `{cypilot_mode}` | `on` or `off` | Current Cypilot mode state |
| `{cpt_cmd}` | `cpt` or `python3 {cypilot_path}/.core/skills/cypilot/scripts/cypilot.py` | Resolved CLI entrypoint |
| `{cpt_installed}` | `true` or `false` | Whether the `cpt` CLI is available |

Setting `{cypilot_mode}`: explicit `cypilot on/off` or a prompt that activates/deactivates Cypilot workflows.

### Template Variable Resolution

- Resolve variables from `{cpt_cmd} --json info` first; parse the returned `variables` dict.
- Use `{cpt_cmd} --json resolve-vars` only when a fresh or filtered map is needed.
- Variable sources: system (`cypilot_path`, `project_root`) + installed kit resources.
- ALWAYS resolve `{variable}` references to absolute paths before using kit markdown files.

## CLI Resolution

Run before Protocol Guard when `{cypilot_mode}` is `on`:
1. `command -v cpt` → `{cpt_cmd} = cpt`, `{cpt_installed} = true`
2. Otherwise `{cpt_cmd} = python3 {cypilot_path}/.core/skills/cypilot/scripts/cypilot.py`, `{cpt_installed} = false`
3. If `cpt` is missing and `~/.cypilot/cache/cpt-prompt-dismissed` does not exist, offer `pipx install git+https://github.com/cyberfabric/cyber-pilot.git`; on dismiss create the marker file
4. Re-offer installation if the user later asks about the long invocation path

ALWAYS use `{cpt_cmd}` for all later CLI invocations.

## Protocol Guard

- ALWAYS FIRST run `{cpt_cmd} --json info` before any Cypilot workflow action
- ALWAYS store the `variables` dict from `info` output and use it to resolve `{variable}` references in AGENTS/SKILL/rules/workflows
- ALWAYS follow this load order: `info` → registry/intent/target/rules resolution from `execution-protocol.md` → matched WHEN-clause specs
- ALWAYS open and remember `{cypilot_path}/.gen/AGENTS.md` after `info` succeeds; use it for navigation and WHEN-clause matching
- ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md` when it exists and the current route or matched WHEN clause requires it
- ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.gen/SKILL.md` when it exists and the current route or matched WHEN clause requires it
- ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/SKILL.md` when it exists and the current route or matched WHEN clause requires it
- ALWAYS load matched WHEN-clause specs only after registry understanding, target determination, and `rules.md` resolution provide enough context to match safely
- MUST NOT preload every AGENTS/SKILL/spec file up front; load only the smallest set needed for the current request
- Before opening a large AGENTS/SKILL/spec file, estimate size and prefer chunked reads of matched sections over full-file reads
- If safe WHEN-clause matching is not yet possible, stop after registry/target/rules resolution and continue only when enough context exists to load specs boundedly
- If required Protocol Guard context would exceed the current turn budget, checkpoint or escalate instead of proceeding with partial or unbounded spec loading
- ALWAYS include this block when editing code:
```text
Cypilot Context:
- Cypilot: {path}
- Target: {artifact|codebase}
- Specs loaded: {list paths or "none required"}
```
- ALWAYS stop and re-run Protocol Guard when required specs should have been loaded but were not

## Cypilot Mode

- ALWAYS set `{cypilot_mode} = on` first when user invokes `cypilot {prompt}`
- ALWAYS run `info` when enabling Cypilot mode
- ALWAYS show:
```text
Cypilot Mode Enabled
Cypilot: {FOUND at path | NOT_FOUND}
```

## Agent-Safe Invocation

- ALWAYS use `{cpt_cmd} --json <subcommand> [options]` for agent-driven CLI calls unless a command-specific exception below says otherwise
- ALWAYS pass `--json` immediately after `{cpt_cmd}` and before the subcommand when using machine-output mode
- EXCEPTION: NEVER run `{cpt_cmd} init` with `--json`; always invoke `{cpt_cmd} init ...` without `--json`
- EXCEPTION: NEVER run `{cpt_cmd} delegate` with `--json`; always invoke `{cpt_cmd} delegate <plan_dir> ...` without `--json`
- EXCEPTION: NEVER run `{cpt_cmd} update` with `--json`; always invoke `{cpt_cmd} update ...` without `--json`
- ALWAYS use `=` form for pattern args starting with `-` (example: `--pattern=-req-`)
- MUST obtain explicit user confirmation before executing any write-capable command, including direct CLI commands that do not route through a workflow
- MUST NOT add auto-approval flags such as `--yes`, `-y`, or `--force` to write-capable commands unless the user explicitly requested that non-interactive behavior

## Quick Commands

### Direct CLI Commands (No Workflow Routing)

No workflow routing skips workflow selection only. It does not waive confirmation: obtain explicit user confirmation before executing any write-capable direct CLI command below.

| User invocation | Direct action |
|---|---|
| `cypilot init` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} init` without `--json` |
| `cypilot update` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} update` without `--json` |
| `cypilot agents <name>` | Run `{cpt_cmd} --json agents --agent <name>` |
| `cypilot generate-agents <name>` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} --json generate-agents --agent <name>` |
| `cypilot workspace init` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} --json workspace-init [--root <dir>] [--output <path>] [--inline] [--force] [--max-depth <N>] [--dry-run]` |
| `cypilot workspace add` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} --json workspace-add --name <name> (--path <path> \| --url <url>) [--branch <branch>] [--role <role>] [--adapter <path>] [--inline] [--force]` |
| `cypilot workspace info` | Run `{cpt_cmd} --json workspace-info` |
| `cypilot workspace sync` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} --json workspace-sync [--source <name>] [--dry-run] [--force]`; `--force` is destructive |

### Workflow Shortcuts

| User invocation | Action |
|---|---|
| `cypilot auto-config` / `cypilot configure` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/generate.md` |

## Workflow Routing

Cypilot has exactly three core workflows plus specialized sub-workflows and dedicated capability agents. Routing priority is `delegate` > `compile-phase` > `execute-phase` > `plan` > `generate`/`analyze`. Delegation intent MUST route to the `cypilot-ralphex` capability agent rather than falling through to generic planning or generation. Generated-plan phase compilation intent MUST route to the dedicated `cypilot-phase-compiler` capability agent, and generated-plan phase execution intent MUST route to the dedicated `cypilot-phase-runner` capability agent rather than back into generic planning.

Oversized-input invariant: if the raw task input exceeds `500` total lines across the direct prompt text, attached or provided files, or one large file, Cypilot MUST route through `/cypilot-plan` before any direct `/cypilot-generate` or `/cypilot-analyze` execution. The planner MUST first compute the input signature using the read-only `{cpt_cmd} --json chunk-input ... --dry-run` mode (which writes no files) to check for existing package reuse, and MUST obtain explicit user approval before materializing that input under `{cypilot_path}/.plans/{task-slug}/input/` using the write-capable `{cpt_cmd} --json chunk-input ... --max-lines 300 --threshold-lines 500` command (without `--dry-run`). The planner MUST pass `--include-stdin` when direct prompt text must be packaged together with provided files; when stdin is used, it MUST also preserve that raw prompt as `input/direct-prompt.md`. The emitted chunk files become mandatory plan inputs for the relevant phases.

Completion invariants for workflow outputs:
- A `/cypilot-plan` run is not complete until it reaches one of three valid stopping points defined by `workflows/plan.md`: `(a)` the raw-input approval checkpoint, where the planner has identified oversized input and presented the `Proceed with raw-input materialization? [y/n]` prompt — the user may approve (`y`) to continue or reject (`n`) to cancel the plan with no filesystem mutations; `(b)` the brief checkpoint where `plan.toml` and every required `brief-*` file exist on disk and the response presents the explicit next-step choice set; or `(c)` the fully compiled plan state where every corresponding `phase-*` file also exists on disk after the user chose inline generation or `cypilot-phase-compiler` execution.
- A `/cypilot-generate` run that wrote or updated any files is not complete until the final response includes both `Plan Review Prompt` and `Direct Review Prompt` blocks. This applies on both the validated success path and the RELAXED explicitly unvalidated recovery path.
- A `/cypilot-analyze` run with any actionable issue is not complete until the final response includes both `Fix Prompt` and `Plan Prompt` blocks.
- A `/cypilot delegate` run is not complete until the final response includes delegation status, handoff result or error details, and next-step options.
- A native plan-phase compilation run is not complete until the final response includes compiled phase identity, output file path, and compile-time validation outcome.
- A native plan-phase execution run is not complete until the final response includes executed phase status, manifest update outcome, and the next-phase handoff or recovery action.
- MUST NOT end a workflow response immediately after the summary, analysis report, or next-step options when one of the required prompt pairs is still missing.

| Intent | Match | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Delegate | `delegate`, `delegate to ralphex`, `ralphex execute`, `ralphex review`, `hand off to ralphex`, `run with ralphex`, `ralphex delegation` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/skills/cypilot/agents/cypilot-ralphex.md` |
| Compile phase | `compile phase`, `compile next phase`, `compile plan phase`, `generate phase file`, `compile from brief`, `build phase from brief` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/skills/cypilot/agents/cypilot-phase-compiler.md` |
| Execute phase | `execute phase`, `run next phase`, `continue plan`, `resume plan`, `execute plan phase`, `run plan phase`, `execute the next phase` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/skills/cypilot/agents/cypilot-phase-runner.md` |
| Plan | `plan`, `create a plan`, `execution plan`, `break down`, `decompose`, or `plan to ...` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/plan.md` first |
| Generate | `create`, `edit`, `fix`, `update`, `implement`, `refactor`, `delete`, `add`, `setup`, `configure`, `build`, `code` and user did not say `plan` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/generate.md` |
| Analyze | `analyze`, `validate`, `review`, `check`, `inspect`, `audit`, `compare`, `list`, `show`, `find` and user did not say `plan` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/analyze.md` |
| Workspace | `workspace`, `multi-repo`, `add source`, `add repo`, `cross-reference`, `cross-repo` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/workspace.md` |
| Unclear | `help`, `look at`, `work with`, `handle` | Ask `plan (phased execution) / generate (modify) / analyze (read-only)?` and stop if the user cancels |

`configure` and `auto-config` are workflow shortcuts, not direct no-protocol commands; both route through `generate.md`, which may auto-trigger `requirements/auto-config.md` for brownfield projects with no project-specific rules.

## Auto-Configuration

Use auto-config after `cypilot init` on a brownfield project, when project conventions are unknown, or after major structural changes. It scans structure/conventions, generates `{cypilot_path}/config/rules/{slug}.md`, adds WHEN rules to `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md`, and registers systems in `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml`. Invoke via `cypilot auto-config`, `cypilot configure`, or the automatic offer inside `generate.md`.

## Project Configuration

Project configuration lives in `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` (systems, kits, ignore lists). Artifact registry lives in `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml` (artifact paths, kinds, system mappings, codebase paths, autodetect rules). All commands output JSON when invoked with `--json`. Exit codes: 0=PASS, 1=filesystem error, 2=FAIL.
